0,ParlaMint-NL_2022-01-18-tweedekamer-6.u144,"That's a weird interruption, but okay. Mr. Chairman. This new cabinet wants exactly the opposite. They want us to return sovereignty by giving up multiple veto rights in the European Union. They want to leave the borders wide open, so that we get even more immigrants and lucky seekers and our culture and security go even further. In the choice between welfare state and immigration country, they choose the latter. That's inexcusable and priceless. We now have more asylum seekers' centres in the Netherlands than general hospitals. Do you know what these open borders cost us all and what we could have done with that money? This mass immigration of non-Western immigrants costs us EUR 20 billion every year. Add to that the billions that Rutte IV is throwing away in climate and nitrogen policies and billions in development aid to Brussels, and you come to astronomical amounts. We could have spent that money a lot better, like care. We shouldn't have cut 5 billion, but we should have invested billions. With that money, we could have made the Netherlands safer by investing in much more police. The Netherlands needs at least 10,000 extra agents, so that every city, every village, has a strong police presence throughout the country. Now the thugs are often the boss on the street. Everywhere we see destruction, abuse and theft. Last year, 5,500 cars burned in the Netherlands. People get threatened and spit on. The unsubs get away with it all the time. It's been like that for years. That must end once and for all. Take them, get them off the street and give them serious punishment. Mr. Chairman. There's a lot more we can do with all that money. Think of all the pensioners I mentioned at the beginning of my contribution. Surely it is an indescribable disgrace how they are treated? It's rude what this cabinet is doing to them. For years, pensioners have not been given any indexing of their pensions. Rutte IV also does not care about the elderly. In this country, it's better to be an asylum seeker than a retired person. You'll be treated better. The PVV considers it unacceptable that benefits and minimum wage should be increased, but not the AOW. I ask the Prime Minister where this hatred of the elderly comes from. What's going on? What do you have against the elderly? They've built our country, but they're not getting anything. You destroyed our country and you're back in the turret. Mr. Chairman. Pensioners in the Netherlands deserve not only an indexed pension, but also a higher AOW benefit, which is linked to the increase in the minimum wage. In the coming years, this cabinet will spend EUR 75 billion on everything. Shame on you, Mr. Rutte. Shame on you for spending EUR 75 billion, but you don't have a few billion left to increase the AOW of older people. Mr. Chairman. Whatever the breakdown of the Netherlands is, the plans for care are. This cabinet refuses to increase the ic capacity in the Netherlands structurally, not even to the average in European countries. It wants to keep the hospitals on the zero in the next year. So it wants to squeeze even more on the hospitals. The cabinet is even thinking of cutting a further EUR 5 billion on healthcare. That is an unprecedented disgrace. It's a huge blow to the face of everyone who works in care and anyone who uses it. Mr. Chairman. Then the nursing homes. In the nursing homes there is already a shortage of 31,000 employees. The cabinet is making this worse by a further EUR 400 million in structural savings on staff in nursing homes. That's inhumane. It's mostly unheard of as well. Dozens of billions! Dozens of billions of dollars spent on D66 hobbies, like nitrogen, but let our elders rot in the nursing home. They're the wrong choices from the wrong people in the wrong cabinet. Mr. Chairman. The Dutch are sick of the restrictions of freedom by corona. In the last month, we were back in a hard lockdown, as the only country in Europe, because we have half less ic capacity than the average in European countries. Meanwhile, the omikron variant is dominant. It's mild. Hospitals are empty. The Netherlands must now choose. Is it going to be blunt repression with 2G, demonstrations with unfortunately the associated violence, or are we, like the United Kingdom, going to scale down, tape down and learn to live as normally as possible with the virus? The PVV opts for the latter, but especially for investing in the care. So let the catering industry open today and give us our freedoms back. Mr. Chairman. Then the purchasing power. We find it unacceptable that Dutch people should return. Inflation is about 5% to 6%, the highest level in 40 years. Our money's gonna be worth less every day. And it is the middle incomes and the lower incomes that suffer the most from these high inflation rates, which far exceed the increase in wages. Working people, elderly people, single people and families: fuck Rutte IV. I really wonder: what world do these ministers actually live in? Who are they here for anyway? Do they have any idea how ordinary people can make ends meet? Is there anyone who'll tell them that? Is there anyone who tells them that people often have trouble paying their rent now, and that people have no idea how to incur the enormous rising energy costs and how to cough up their own risk in care? Do you know they have to tap the pump at the world's second-highest gas price? Do you know that groceries for people only become more expensive and expensive? And do you know that this is a huge disaster for millions of Dutch people? You reserve 60 billion for climate and nitrogen, but you do not compensate ordinary people for inflation, making everything more expensive, such as the energy bill. That makes you the worst cabinet ever. I want you to compensate 100% for the increase in the Dutch energy bill. Mr. Chairman. Of course, this cabinet is not what the Netherlands voted for last year. Last March, on the right, we received a majority in the elections, but we now have an extremely left-wing cabinet, which only seems to represent the Urgenda climate drones and refugee fanatics, with a VVD Secretary of State for Immigration and Asylum who said earlier: ""The more asylum seekers, the better."" That's a quote. Mr. Chairman. The VVD has gone crazy. They gave everything away. It is as if D66 achieved the absolute majority of the votes last March. Mrs. Kaag showed Rutte all the corners of the room. It was bending for Kaag or function elsewhere for Rutte. That was the only way for Rutte to stay in power. That is also the only thing that interests him: me, me, and the rest of the Netherlands can choke. He has chosen for his own sake and our country further collapsed the left-liberal decay of Kaag. Because Sigrid Kaag hates the Netherlands. She wants to destroy the Netherlands completely. It wants more European Union, more lucky seekers and immigrants, more money for development aid and Africa. So Rutte signed with the cross. So nothing will change at all. The talk, the deception, the lies, the hypocrisy, the wrong choices: everything remains the same or only gets worse. Rutte IV is Kaag I or Woke I or Ramp I; choose; it's all wrong.",True,0.125,0.777,0.098,-0.9944,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-01-18-tweedekamer-6,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 38, Session 6 (2022-01-18)",2022-01-18,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 6,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-01-18,-,COVID,English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,PVV,Partij voor de Vrijheid,Opposition,Right to far-right,GeertWilders,"Wilders, Geert",M,1963,59.0,False,1
1,ParlaMint-NL_2022-01-18-tweedekamer-9.u252,"Mr. Chairman. After ten months of forming, I think that a lot of people are relieved that there is finally a declaration of government and that we are finally moving again, because we here together may understand exactly what happened in all these ten months, but I fear that this does not apply to most Dutch people. When I was in my home, politics wasn't much of a topic either. It wasn't until my parents ran into the government more and more. My brother was diagnosed with minimal brain dysfunction. It was called MBD back then. That's kind of a container concept for kids who couldn't come all the way to school because of behavior or anything unclear. Every child is busy, isn't he? That's how it was done. The solution was sometimes the advice to stop eating candy. My mom was having a hard time with that, because how can doctors not know what's wrong with him? That was the signal for her to take action. She also wanted to help other parents in a similar situation. That's how she got involved in the Parental Association Balance. This is now the parent association for parents of children with learning and development problems, such as ADHD, dyslexia and autism. My mother wasn't academically educated. She went to the school for social work in Baarn, but she really wanted to know everything about learning and behavioral disorders. The stack of scientific literature was getting higher and higher at home. The more she read, the more she wondered: what good is this for parents? So she decided to write herself. Books full, for the parents, so they could help their children better. Her first book was called ""Be normal."" Because that was the spoils that children with ADHD so often heard and with which they could nothing at all. As a result of her work, she was allowed to contribute to the advice of the Health Council. Then the committee was listed under such advice: professor doctor De Beaufort, professor of medical ethics, professor doctor Boer, professor of paediatric and youth psychiatry, professor of doctor Oosterlaan, professor of psychiatric neuropsychology, and Mrs Paternotte of the parent association. Her books were working. Parents were happy about it, but these kids also needed a government. Because it doesn't matter if you get extra time on an exam as a child and can take an oral test more often, that there can be extra guidance at school, that medicines are reimbursed. So more and more at home it was about the Binnenhof, about politics. She and her colleagues realized that if you want to change something, you have to be in The Hague a lot. For example, that hour came extra for children with dyslexia. Her struggle in The Hague brought politics to our home. One day my mother got a call from a political party that was good for the polls, with a handsome young curly as group leader. This party also often stood up for education and parents. They asked if she was interested in the House of Representatives. As you can see, I am talking about Paul Rosenmöller's GroenLinks. My mom just didn't seem anything. She didn't think she had enough patience for politics. She'd rather really just stay the voice of the parents. But because of her story, I know very well that what we do here with each other matters very much in people's lives, and that politics only works when it comes to what people need to move forward, not what the system requires of them. That is exactly the question I would like to put to this cabinet, namely to deliver on that promise. Madam President. What I also expect from this cabinet is for it to repair and protect the democratic rule of law, which is under pressure, all over the world. Unfree countries are becoming even more autocratic, such as Russia and China. Free countries are becoming less free. The United States is still licking the wounds of the storming of the Capitol, driven by its own losing president. Orbán abused the corona crisis to further concentrate his power. The Polish government party made an attempt to illegally turn the elections into their own hands. What happens there can happen here. The safe survival of our democracy is not a matter of course. There are enough threats to worry about, from the outside and from the inside. On the outside, we see the aggression of foreign powers and the dangerous potential of Big Tech. In the coalition agreement, this cabinet wants to counter foreign influence. It wants strong European defence and pays a lot of money for the armed forces and cybersecurity, because we know that Russia does not back down from annexation and violence and that surveillance at the Ukrainian border is now being done by the British and Americans, while Europe should be able to contribute in its own backyard. From the inside, we see to our horror that the government can turn against its own citizens, from parenting to Groninger, where access to justice is inadequate. We can also see that society hardens and undermines the inspiration and example of what is happening in our parliament and also in local democracy. Democracy is under pressure from a radicalising anti-democratic movement. That is a movement that uses very cynically the feelings of distrust, a movement that is not constructive but destructive, which always blames the other for essential problems. This movement demands tribunals and hits people with repulsive conspiracies, contributing to an atmosphere in which politicians and other public figures are threatened with death. The cabinet is therefore going to improve the monitoring and security system and put a lot of money into it. That must be because a lawyer and a journalist were murdered in our country, because the first thing some ministers see now when they walk out the door is a police station, because scientists who work for us all are threatened. I refer to the free press, such as the journalists of the NIS who work under an editorial statute which guarantees their independence but which is now hampered in their work, which plays such an important role in a free society. That's not normal. As long as it is, we must rise up against these extremes. So, against the expectations of the cabinet, I also have an expectation of what we can do ourselves in the interests of a functioning democratic rule of law with a sound political culture. My group will always try to cooperate with all reasonable forces in the interests of democracy. And you can. Of course, such a coalition agreement is not just the result of two months of negotiations with four parties. What the coalition now intends to do often has a long history, a history that always transcends parties and coalitions. Like the idea of almost free childcare. Essential for emancipation. This is originally from the case of the Labour Party, the Wood/Van Aartsen motion. And now it's finally coming. The constitutional review was an idea of GroenLinks, the Halsema law, a good idea, which in the immediate sense brings back the balance in our democratic system. Now it becomes reality. The abolition of the bio-industry was an important reason for the founding of the Party for Animals. This coalition takes that over gratefully. I have proposed the CO ceiling for aviation in order to protect creation together with Chris Stoffer of the SGP and now government policy. Thinking back to this morning, I find it sometimes difficult for myself to think cynically that political culture is a given and that it is always hard against hard, that the nuance is missing, that you really cannot talk freely. I can imagine that perhaps everyone in this room will feel that way, but we would be better off with a different culture. A political culture in which we are not in those trenches but in an ancient Dutch circle. Old habits wear off slowly. That's gonna apply to me, too. Political struggle remains necessary about its content. If we can see here today that the coalition will look openly at the ideas of all parties and that the opposition does not reject everything in advance, then the parliament can become what it should be, a place where all the wishes and ideas of society come together, so that people feel heard and so that together we determine the future, sometimes with great strides, often with small ones. Sometimes I certainly do not rule that out. The opposition is more right than the coalition and is right. I remember that at the start of the previous cabinet, Lodewijk Asscher called into question the plan for pay dispensation for labour restrictions and a year later, together with the coalition, also brushed away that plan. Mr. Chairman. I read the coalition agreement, and then I thought, the sooner this is implemented, the better. Because it's very social, ambitious and progressive. Everything is intended to guide people fairly and diligently through that transition period. It is ambitious, just when I think of that 60% reduction in emissions by 2030, which Rob Jetten now stands for, with the support of his colleagues. Minister Jetten will have to pull everything out of the closet and will need all his colleagues to do so: from the flight tax to the CO tax and from sustainable housing to windmills at sea. It is ambitious because of the revolution in agriculture, which will visibly change our country forever with fewer megasthals and more nature and clean air. It's ambitious for science. Finally, researchers and universities get the support they need for their crucial work. It is social, with a new impetus for legal aid, with a substantial increase in the minimum wage and with the largest structural investment ever made in equal opportunities through good education and almost free childcare. It's social, because we're gonna be patient with kids and students again. It is progressive, with substantial investment in culture, with room for the Chamber to answer questions of life and death, such as the law completed life and other medical-ethical issues, and with the first state commission ecstasy in the world. This is a cabinet that more than ever looks like the Netherlands, with the diversity that is our strength. That is why racism and women hate are tackled and attention is paid to all pages of our history, with a National Historical Museum and a slavery museum. With the agreements of the coalition agreement, the cabinet tries to create space in everything it radiates for people who are different, who just need a little more time, who move forward with patience and attention. That's what my mother tried to do at the core, first for my brother and then for so many others. That's what drives me in politics. The direction is good, but that of course is not a guarantee for result. So my group wants to be an independent driver in the coming years. In our view of politics, it is not about who can come up with the most beautiful plans or achieve the most beautiful agreements. It's about what you can make of it. So I would like to give one warning to the cabinet: my group is an impatient group. So I'm gonna ask the Cabinet this. When does the first mega-shower sign an abhorrent contract with the climate minister? When will Hugo de Jonge put the first new kick in the ground at Amsterdam, Utrecht or one of those other cities where people are stuck by ridicule house prices? When will the Prime Minister raise the glass with Macron and Scholz to an autonomous, strategically strong Europe? When will the first student receive his basic grant? When do primary school teachers receive their first paychecks at the same level as secondary school colleagues? When is this big city gonna be able to start with regulated weed cultivation? And as a basis for everything that we want to achieve: how does the government intend to solve the shortage in the labour market, in other words, how do we ensure that we train people quickly enough to live up to our childcare, climate and education plans? Mr. Chairman. The democratic rule of law that is so dear to us will only continue to exist if people have confidence in it. Enemies of democracy tell us that democracy does not provide solutions for people. They're wrong. That's what we want to show you. That is also the ambition expressed in the agreement and in the statement made by the cabinet today. That is also the task that we warmly welcome.",True,0.076,0.786,0.138,0.9994,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-01-18-tweedekamer-9,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 38, Session 9 (2022-01-18)",2022-01-18,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 9,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-01-18,-,COVID,English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,JanPaternotte,"Paternotte, Jan",M,1984,38.0,False,1
2,ParlaMint-NL_2022-01-18-tweedekamer-9.u368,"Mr. Chairman. First of all, of course, the heartfelt congratulations of Belang van Nederland, van BVNL, to this cabinet. We'll try to be constructive. Let's hope the damage doesn't get too big. We will, of course, be very critical of you. Mr. Chairman. We're witnessing a coup new style. New style, because it is carried out by a democratically legitimized government. Yet there is nothing democratic about the plans. Is there a majority in the Netherlands for an EU army? BVNL doesn't think so. Is there a majority for decoupling the AOW from the minimum wage? BVNL doesn't think so. Is there a majority in favour of using crisis legislation for the climate or buying out farmers? Of course not. These are huge decisions that were not included in any election programme. So the Dutch got something completely different from what they voted for. Doesn't the Prime Minister think that a referendum on these matters would be an excellent means of achieving this? Mr. Chairman. If you fail, you stay put. That's exactly what the Cabinet did. The people responsible for the premium affair, in which tens of thousands of families were crushed by the State, are once again in trade union K, without shame. The people who decided to close the gas field in Groningen and ignored the Groningen for years and didn't compensate, continue without remorse. The people who were in charge of the chaotic and amateur flight from Afghanistan pretend that nothing happened, without scruples. And the same people who degenerate a seasonal virus into a disaster for the Netherlands by opting for lockdowns, fear and repression instead of common sense and natural immunity, are just sitting there again, as if they were not guilty of this disaster. On the contrary: just tweeting that you're sitting on the couch with popcorn watching the extension of the lockdown, which means that many catering entrepreneurs are now considering suicide. Mr. Chairman. In the Netherlands, SMEs have always been the engine of the economy, the backbone of society. With the Rutte IV cabinet, that is forever over. This cabinet bets on the State as the waterhead of society. Extra-compatible Giga funds will be used to lend and spend 90 billion extra over five years. That is electoral deception of an unprecedented magnitude, because no coalition party promised the voters this huge mountain of debt, which will have to be repaid by our children. According to the CPB, public debt is going to reach a hallucinatory rate of 90% of GDP in 2060. Can the Prime Minister explain what that means when interest rates rise to 2%, 3% or perhaps even 5%? What is he going to say to our children, who we leave with a bankrupt Netherlands? And who's gonna pay for this pottering? Will the government be the economic engine of the Netherlands? The government is a cost. The money is earned in the real economy, by companies where people work. But this cabinet creates hundreds of thousands of new jobs for civil servants. The CPB calculated that employment in other sectors fell sharply. So for a job, you're gonna have to be with the government from now on. The municipalities are also reduced. The local government must give way to the national government. All these developments point in one direction. The almighty State becomes the waterhead of society. It's a coup new style. The rulers choose their own path, separated from the promises to their voters. BVNL is fundamental against this growing government power, with giga funds and an explosion in the number of officials. Can the Prime Minister explain to each fund how the Chamber can carry out its controlling task? Mr. Chairman. BVNL is for a business office. This cabinet doesn't look like it. But the strange thing is, at least I find it strange that D66 still provides the majority of directors qualified for their new position. Robbert Dijkgraaf on Education, Ernst Kuipers on Health and Gunay Uslu on Culture deserves applause. With Henk Staghouwer, this cabinet counts only one entrepreneur. That's a little skinny. But there have also been incomprehensible changes: the iron-strong Minister for Finance Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, a Secretary of Defense who doesn't know the military isn't unique, but someone who doesn't know the difference between a sergeant and a major is somewhat offensive. Let's hope we don't have a war in the next few years. But fortunately in this cabinet is also the honored Afghanistan veteran Captain Hanke Bruins Slot. That gives the citizens courage again, should Ukraine fail. But the main concern on this file is, of course, the threat of a European army. Can the Prime Minister guarantee that this will not happen and that, if he intends to do so, he will at least have a referendum there? Mr. Chairman. I would like to make a few specific points. The corona measures have caused enormous damage and have deeply divided our country. Entrepreneurs are at the edge of the abyss. RIVM models consistently fail. Vaccination does not appear to be the way to the promised country and yet the cabinet wants to introduce 2G and start vaccination of healthy children. Opponents and opponents are opposed to each other. Can the Prime Minister indicate how this cabinet will prevent further polarization? Mr. Chairman. Then there is energy policy. There are no limits to mispolicy in the field of energy transition. We've wasted billions of dollars on useless windmills, solar fields and polluting biomass plants. An ordinary household is now going to pay hundreds of euros a month more for the energy bill. The Groninger gas field closes because we are too bad to maintain the pressure in the field by applying, for example, water injection. The Dutch energy policy knows nothing but losers. Can the Prime Minister indicate whether he is prepared to look at solutions that are technically good for the environment and stop doing things that are demonstrably bad? And talk to an engineer for once. There's one behind you: Mrs. Van Gennip studied physics in Delft. I'm sure she can give you a tutoring lesson. Mr. Chairman. We now have a Minister for Nitrogen. In view of my limited speaking time, I would like to refer this Minister to the columns of Ronald Plasterk and the previous interruption of myself and Mrs Van der Plas. There is no nitrogen crisis, there is just a crisis in governance. Finally, Mr President. There are 2 million entrepreneurs in the Netherlands who suffer from the government, unnecessary rules and improper competition by the government. They suffer from the bureaucracy surrounding labour law and absenteeism. The locational environment is downright poor and the cost of exorbitant expenditure is largely borne by the business community. But the Netherlands cannot be without entrepreneurs, not without people taking risks, hard work, being creative and making things. It would be good if this cabinet, even though it is mainly made up of people who have never been entrepreneurs, would realize that, in the interests of the Netherlands.

3,ParlaMint-NL_2022-01-19-tweedekamer-3.u4,"Mr. Chairman. I shall begin with the situation in the world, with particular reference to the situation at the margins of Europe. Before I go into that, it should be noted that developments are not only encouraging within Europe and within the European Union. I have said it many times, even here in debates on the European Union and on the European Council: the cabinet is concerned about the slowness of decision-making on a number of very large issues in Europe. This is linked, among other things, to the situation surrounding Poland and Hungary, i.e. to the discussions on rule of law. It should also be noted that, of course, there are also developments in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. A new government has been in place in Slovakia for a long time and a new government has just taken office in the Czech Republic. These offer prospects for cooperation with countries that are now referred to as the Visegrad area, as the Visegrad countries. After the fall of the wall, these four countries have united to promote rapid accession to the European Union and are, like the Benelux countries, a permanent dialogue within the European Union. It is a less homogeneous block than in the past, but there is, of course, a continuing concern about the situation in Poland and Hungary. This does not strengthen the functioning of the European Union. We saw it in the last European Council when it was about energy. Not only was there a threat of a blockade, but the whole block of conclusions on energy was actually blocked until the end of the sitting. That was for me, and I've been sitting there for a while... a ""first."" This happened from Poland, among other places. This was also intended to send a signal about the situation. Having said that, the situation that is now developing on the Russian-Ukrainian border is, of course, extremely worrying. In doing so, the Netherlands and Europe will choose a route that will work both on dialogue and on putting pressure on them. The German Foreign Minister is currently in the region. Wopke Hoekstra, the Dutch Foreign Minister, and I intend to travel to Ukraine soon. We are, of course, involved in these discussions within Europe in all possible ways. You have seen that the new Foreign Minister has spoken with Borrell, the High Representative. He has also spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart, with sg Stoltenberg of NATO and with his American colleague. The talks with the French and German counterparts are in the pipeline. When I was in Berlin last week, with Olaf Scholz, the new German chancellor, the conversation also went to an important extent about developments on the outskirts of Europe. Again, we must keep the dialogue going here, and at the same time it is extremely important that Europe is also able to prepare a credible package of sanctions. In this respect, we believe it is essential that these sanctions are not only applied if there is a strong Russian action towards Ukraine, but also if there is a need to take account of a less far-reaching military operation. Yeah, what's less extreme? Because any military operation is, of course, unacceptable. It is important, and I would like to give that signal to Moscow and Russia once again, that even if a possible military operation were to be less extensive, the price for Russia would be very high. It's important that they realize that. The German Chancellor and I were also in total agreement on this. Fortunately, in Europe too, you are seeing an increasing degree of convergence on this issue. There is, of course, a great deal of agreement here, both between the Eastern European part of the European Union and the Western European part, let us say the former European Union. So that's good news in itself. I am pleased that there is good coordination between NATO, the European Union and the OSCE, which also plays an important role. But again, it must be clear to Moscow, to Putin, to Russian leadership, that any action, whatever its form, will have serious political and economic consequences from Russia towards Ukraine and that the cost of aggression is therefore high. It is true, this is developing at the moment and we are indeed discussing very important issues here. But this international context cannot, of course, be overlooked. The Netherlands is therefore very closely connected to this. We are, of course, the sixth country in size within Europe, the fifth country in terms of economy of the 27 European countries. Of course, we are a lot smaller than France and Germany, but also not so much smaller than Spain. So we really have to play this role and we are also looking at the Netherlands, because we are one of the founders of the European Union, the most important country in the Benelux and, I repeat, the fifth economy and the sixth country of the European Union. Of course, the Netherlands is also expected to participate actively in this type of subject. Mr. Chairman. There are still a few questions about abroad. There are no plans for a European army, but to cooperate much more in the field of defence within Europe in the coming years, as we are already doing with Germany, with the United Kingdom and with Belgium. It is very important that we work well within NATO, within the alliance, within the European area, but also with those countries that are not members of NATO such as Sweden and Finland. Of course, the use of our armed forces will always remain a national competence, there is no discussion about that. A question was also asked about procurement policy of defence equipment. As you can see, in the coalition agreement, we have once again stressed the importance of this open strategic autonomy of European territory, including as regards international security. That is why we want to give new impetus to military cooperation, with, of course, transatlantic relations as a cornerstone. Defence applies European procurement rules and makes use of existing exceptions when requested by national security. I am looking in the direction of Mr Dassen van Volt because he asked that question. This can be done, among other things, through the European Defence Fund, but also through what has become known as PESCO projects, the projects in the framework of permanent structured defence cooperation. The existing military partnerships, such as with Belgium and Germany, also offer opportunities for joint material projects.

4,ParlaMint-NL_2022-01-19-tweedekamer-3.u7,"That was indeed a fierce part of yesterday's debate. First of all, a dual nationality certainly does not prevent her appointment in the cabinet. We also saw this in 2007 with the appointments of Aboutaleb and Albayrak, in 2010 with Mrs Van Zanten and in 2017 with Mrs Ollongren. The same goes for now. I do not ask the candidates whether they have a dual nationality; they may have a dual nationality. It doesn't stand in the way in any way and doesn't say anything about their loyalty. I think the combination of dual nationality and loyalty is a very vulnerable one. In 2007, as chairman of the political group, I made very firm statements about this. I wouldn't repeat it like that, and why not? Because I also see that the complexity of a dual nationality and the question of how you deal with it are much more complex than I realized in 2007. It also has to do with all kinds of issues that play in the country of origin, for example about inheritance law. I would certainly not repeat those statements with that certainty. It is true that the law is clear in the Netherlands: the aim is to have one nationality if I may summarize it, but in many cases it cannot be lifted for practical or even legal reasons. The cabinet wants to work on a register for an unwanted second nationality if you wanted to give it up but couldn't give it up. That's what the coalition agreement says. We are also looking at how to deal with people with Dutch nationality abroad who have to give up that nationality after so many years. But perhaps back to yesterday's debate. Having two nationalities doesn't mean anything about loyalty. Mrs Yeşilgöz fled Turkey in the 1980s as a refugee from the military dictatorship.

I think that the military threat by Russia, the fact that there are troops in Belarus, is really a shadow over this debate too. In the last ten years, of course, there have been two annexations/invasions in a neighbouring country of the European Union. Now they're talking about spheres of influence again, Yalta 2.0. At the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin divided Europe into two blocs of power without Europe being at the table. And now you actually see that Europe does not have a strong position at the table either. This really must be the year of a European defence policy, of a European foreign policy, so that we can ensure that Europe can go beyond its own security and help protect its own borders. My question is: what will the Netherlands do to make that possible, to ensure that we can make that contribution?

We have had this debate while the threat of a Russian military operation is on the outskirts of Europe. I am pleased that we have been able to reflect on this and that the Prime Minister has said that his absolute priority in foreign policy is the coming year to ensure that Europe can play that role in defence in its own backyard. But also here in the Netherlands, because we see this radical anti-democratic movement that acts in conspiracy theories and contributes to it and helps create a culture in which it is possible to make threats against scientists, journalists, politicians and so many others. The third task I would like to give to the cabinet is urgent, because we would like to see the coalition agreement implemented as soon as possible.

8,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-02-tweedekamer-3.u15,"This is, of course, avenging that I and the committee debate have not done and that I am also working in a very small way. So I don't really know if we can do this. Let me agree with the Chamber that I look at the possibilities in this area. Then I can just get that information. Then I'll tell you later if you can do that or if you've gotten anything out of it. Then I come to the motions that have been tabled. The motion in part No. 341 is about the preservation of the Long Jaap. A few questions have also been asked about this. Mr Van der Molen actually asked: how did it come to this and what do we do, above all, to prevent repetition? My predecessor on this dossier, Minister Visser, also expressed regret in the autumn that the Lange Jaap has been able to escape the attention of those responsible for many years. I'll repeat that to her. I did the same in the region last Monday. It's just that a lot of things didn't go well here. Over the years there have been inspections every time, but then little or nothing has been done with the recommendations. We must learn a great deal from that. We ourselves are still in the dark when it comes to the Lange Jaap during a number of periods. This concerns why certain inspections have not been followed up. My predecessor has already instructed the sg of the Ministry to dive into that further and to re-examine the whole decision-making process and all the underlying documents. As soon as that becomes more apparent, I will of course inform the Chamber. At the same time, it was decided to inspect the other lighthouses, the other monuments, on the basis of the Lange Jaap case last autumn. The first preliminary results are that we have not found situations like the Lange Jaap, but a further inspection is taking place in a number of places. The commitment made by my predecessor to involve the Chamber step by step, I am following her and following her. So as soon as there's more news, I'll report it to the Chamber. Then there's the motion on the Lange Jaap. I would also like to say one thing in advance. Mr Van der Molen also said that the tower is on the brink of collapse one minute and seems to be saved at the next. I would just like to point out where we are now, because it really goes step by step and last Monday there was a first small point of light. In any case, where the tower's surroundings had to be hermetically enclosed because of its safety and the risk of falling over, the experts have now found that the tower can be inspected with a drone. But that really is a tiny point of light. That investigation must show whether the tower can be accessed by humans at all. The word ""saved"" is called. In that respect, I would like to reduce expectations. I sincerely hope so, and my whole will is to preserve the tower. Ultimately, it is safe and can also be technically realistic. That being said, I come to the motion. In the end, I would advise your Chamber to leave the judgment to the Chamber, but I would like to say something about the operative part. The operative part says 'to provide clarity in the shortest possible time', but 'the shortest possible time' can really take a while. I fear this will be a process of months, if not years. If that drone goes in soon, it can, of course, make all the recordings in a day or so, but the interpretation of the data and the images it produces really has to be done by experts. It does not therefore mean that the next step can be taken at the end of the day. It will take a while, but every moment there is news, I will inform your Chamber. Now that the motion also says 'in the case of decommissioning to provide for a replica', I hope that the conclusion of this debate is not that we are heading towards dismantling. Everything is aimed at seeing if we can keep the tower. I can see the headlines again, so that's why I'm saying it so literally. On that part of the operative part, I say: if the conclusion is that dismantling is ultimately the only option, then the motion asks to provide for a replica. At the same time, the agreements are also regional, especially with the municipality of Den Helder, with the residents, with the National Cultural Heritage Agency and with the participation of the surrounding area to see what we can do. I also want to go through that route carefully. This is a very digital pronunciation. If you give me the opportunity to include the others in that scenario, who may have conflicting opinions about it or any other opinion than that it should be a replica, then I would like to give the 'judgement chamber' motion with due regard for that explanation. I see the petitioner nodding. Then the motion to part No. 342 over sailing degassing. The committee debate held an executive debate on this subject. I suspect that Mrs Bouchallichh, with all the sympathy I have for the approach of the motion, already feels what I am going to say, namely that I should discourage the motion in this form. This is a case in which both the Dutch Government and the Dutch Parliament have been united for years and believes that this degassing should be stopped as soon as possible. At the same time, I do not have the opportunity to introduce it in this way. Like my predecessor, I am very disappointed that the ratification of the treaty in which we agreed to ban degassing has been delayed in some of the Member States concerned. The Netherlands and Germany have ratified it, but Switzerland, for example, has not yet ratified it. I'm afraid it's gonna take a while. Like my predecessor, I will endeavour to continue to appeal to other governments in the countries concerned. The route proposed by Mrs Bouchallichh in the motion, namely through the ADN, is not passable. It is true that you have to set a number of criteria yourself, but the aim of the ADN Treaty is not to ban degassing. Here's the thing. If we were to use this route and draw up such strict criteria that there is nowhere else to be done in the Netherlands, we would have another discussion with neighbouring countries, because de facto it will then take place in Germany, where the Treaty has not yet entered into force. There are the same issues with the construction of the degassing plants. We then turn the problem into a neighbouring country, which, moreover, has done its best and has ratified the Treaty and has no opportunity to fill the gap that we then leave. But everything is aimed at squeezing the other countries to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.",True,0.06,0.86,0.08,0.9766,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-02-tweedekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 45, Session 3 (2022-02-02)",2022-02-02,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 45,Sitting 2022-02-02,-,COVID,English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,MarkHarbers,"Harbers, Mark",M,1969,53.0,False,2
9,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-02-tweedekamer-4.u4,"I'm just getting ripped out of my own party. Mr. Chairman. First of all, a welcome to the Minister. I am glad that we can have this debate. Over the last few days, I've read the book Shadow War Uruzgan. It gives a rather sobering picture of the difference between the debates that have taken place here in the Chamber and the reality, in this case in Uruzgan. That's what we saw at LIMC. Things went wrong. I don't speak it right, and I'm glad there's an independent investigation coming up right now. At the same time, however, there was a tendency, last April, but also in the last committee debate, which said, among other things, that our armed forces were being deployed against our own citizens. That is, of course, not true, because our armed forces are being used to protect our citizens. The reality is that the world is changing. That's what we're seeing in Ukraine now. Cyber's just a part of the military tools, and it has to stay that way. It is a grey area and we need to look at the frameworks within which we can act. That's why I have a few questions for the Minister. Earlier in the budget process, we have asked for virtual training space for information-driven action, so that our armed forces can practice in this area. I was wondering if I could get an update. I often hear, for example, in a recent conversation with the Air Mobile Brigade in Assen, that more and more soldiers are dropping out because they are just practicing and can never be deployed in operational areas. This threat also exists with cyber specialists, because the business community is very keen on these talents that we need in the armed forces. We're afraid that, pending the investigation, these people might not be able to be used for what they're trained for and what we need them for, and that they're running away. I'm asking the Minister how she looks at this. Finally. We focus very much on the negative of the LIMC. That is why the question to the Minister is whether there are any positive messages to report and lessons that we can draw from the LIMC. Could we perhaps make predictions on the basis of the information that has been collected, which we could have benefited greatly from? That's it, Mr. Chairman.

10,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-02-tweedekamer-4.u6,"First of all, thank you for the letter we received yesterday from the cabinet. The cabinet itself has already concluded that, if the Chamber asks for an independent inquiry, the Chamber does not ask for an internal investigation. The request for that motion did not contain a word of Spanish at the time. We have submitted them as a VVD. So it is a good thing that this motion is now being carried out with the letter. But then let's get back to the underlying matter. Something the military has always done, when it's deployed far away, is to explore: what's the situation like? For that, you need information-driven action. Only the digital domain has been added; that is what the LIMC issue was about. The cabinet will look: how did they actually practice in the digital domain? It is about collecting and gathering information from social media: what is a particular issue here and what, for example, is our military presence in this country? Those are all very useful things. Then we'll see how they do it in other countries. I think that's a good exercise. Only the question to the Minister is: what glasses are we going to look at the other countries? I think it is important to keep the glasses of military reality in mind. If we send soldiers on mission, we do so because it is potentially dangerous there. This also means that they must be able to collect all the information they need, for the safety, effectiveness and impact of our military. I therefore hope to hear from the Minister today that she is going to make these glasses on the comparison with other countries, so that the security and strength of our military personnel remain at the forefront, including in the application of digital information gathering.

I would also like to wish Mr Van Dijk of the SP from this place. It is indeed the first time that I have been in the Chamber as Minister of Defence. That's a milestone for me. It is the third Minister of Defence when it comes to the LIMC; I think the spokesmen know that very well. I think it would be a good idea to highlight here in my first performance that this is a subject for which my predecessor, Mrs Bijleveld, has apologized to the Chamber. That's what happened next. The most important thing, namely the legal basis for the LIMC and how it was used at the time, appeared to be missing. So that's the starting point. Then your Chamber adopted a number of motions, including the motion by Mrs Belhaj of D66 and a number of co-signators: Mr Stoffer, Mr Boswijk, Mr Kuzu, and Mr Van Wijngaarden, indeed, as he himself said. I think that the literal implementation of that motion, which I have now chosen, is important in the letter to which Mr Van Wijngaarden has just referred. I think it's important to learn from things that haven't gone well. So that's what I'm trying to do. Information, and therefore information-driven operation, is crucial for the armed forces. That's just the way it is. Of course, information has always played a major role in military action, but because of the digital domain that has been added, that has become even more important. Think of all kinds of hybrid forms of conflict that happen in the world. As a result, it is important to be able to acquire, process, disseminate and deploy information in military action. In fact, it is exactly as Mr Van Wijngaarden said. This is important for the work of our military forces and for their security, for our security, for national security and for cooperation with allies. That is why we are trying to define and develop a vision of this information-driven action. This has already been used by the previous cabinet, and we will make use of a number of studies already under way. They were largely the result of the debate here in the Chamber on the LIMC. I think it's more than that.

12,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-02-tweedekamer-4.u13,"The answer to that is yes. Maybe it's okay if I just answer the other questions. I think I can reassure Mr Hammelburg on that point. This consists of different routes. Mr Hammelburg asked for other countries. A request for information has indeed been made to the main European partner countries to see how they have completed this relationship. This is about the relationship between the functioning of the armed forces and the legal basis we have, namely the GDPR, to put it in jargon. The results will be for our input. So we learn from others. The policy vision that is under development, and which I hope we will be able to achieve before the summer, must make it clear what exactly is the legal basis for that operation. So I come up with a bit of what Mr Van Wijngaarden said. Eventually, we have to look at this from a military pair of glasses. It is about the functioning of the armed forces and how they operate, how their own security works, how they can operate as effectively as possible, but also how they ensure that the legal basis is right. That is an important foundation and a basic condition. After all, you don't want to find out later that it isn't. You must have organized that well in front. Because indeed, the world is changing. That's very fast. That is why this must be done as a matter of priority, in the interests of the security and functioning of our armed forces. Then I come to Mr Boswijk's questions and comments. A letter was sent to the Chamber about the update of the virtual rehearsal room. It's from the second half of last year. I believe Henk Kamp sent that letter. There's a lot of stuff in there about that virtual exercise space, and there's a lot of possibilities with that. At the same time, we realize that virtual practice in a counterfeit digital environment is never quite the same as actually doing these kinds of exercises in the real digital world.

14,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-02-tweedekamer-4.u16,"I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a Catholic either. Nevertheless, I would like to comment on the point made by Mr Van Wijngaarden. I understand very well. That's right, that's the way it is. I do think you should ultimately rely on the best possible information, including legal information. In the end, you have to choose a direction politically-administratively and agree on it. If we agree here on the legal basis for the operation of the armed forces, that is what it is. On that basis, our armed forces can act. The aim is not to reach consensus among lawyers. The aim is to achieve consensus in a political-administrative reality, with a legal basis, on which the armed forces can function. It is actually a legal and ethical framework. The projects that are under way and which are partly about that legal framework, the comparison with other countries, the policy framework in the process, the external research that we are doing to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which I had not mentioned yet, are all input for this, together with the external research on LIMC that the Chamber has asked for. In the end, this should fall into a policy framework on information-driven action. And that, in my view, is ultimately the legal framework, I shall say, which we all agree on and which the armed forces should be able to deal with. Mr. Chairman. A few more things; after all, it is only a two-minute debate, although you would almost forget that. I fully agree with what Mr Boswijk said about the commitment. At the same time, it is very difficult to say that we are now going to deploy our forces. That depends on what's happening in the world. Now there's more than enough happening right now, I'd almost say. Fortunately, our soldiers are also being deployed at the moment, for example in Lithuania, at enhanced Forward Presence. I think the analysis that this is about specialized people, in a labour market where there is a lot of demand for that kind of specialisation, for example for technically skilled people, is spot-on. That's just a fact. The work at the Department of Defense is versatile and incredibly interesting. People think it's a nice employer. But, yes, there are other options for people. I have indeed noticed in my first few weeks that an important motive for people to work in the armed forces is that they can also be deployed on mission and actually go to work there. What is equally important is that there is really good practice. We must ensure that these two aspects are in order. I would like to conclude with a final comment, in connection with Mr Van Wijngaarden's contribution to the digital domain. That's extra, but it's become incredibly important. We all know it: even in our daily lives, you can no longer live without that digital domain. It's just become an extra dimension in life. This means, for the intervention of the armed forces, that this dimension must always be involved. That is why I would like to conclude by saying that I think it is very important to learn lessons from the past. That is why I said: we are going to do the external investigation exactly as the Chamber asked for it. I'm gonna get that going as soon as I can.

15,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u4,"Mr. Chairman. The situation in Ukraine is tense and worrying. Although we all want a peaceful diplomatic solution, that is certainly not a certainty. The Netherlands must therefore prepare for various scenarios and count its nodes. For BVNL it is quite clear that under no circumstances should lives of Dutch soldiers be put at risk. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and the list of fallen Dutch soldiers, as exhibited in the State Passage, is exhausting in our view and should not be expanded by this crisis. Delivering defensive weapons to make Ukraine more resilient in a possible Russian invasion is a very different matter for BVNL. After all, whoever lacks the sword must hope for the shield of others. Economic sanctions at EU level are a two-edged sword: Russia is not a dwarf state that can be applied unpunishedly, partly in view of the estimated foreign exchange reserves of 400 to 600 billion dollars, Nord Stream 2 and gas supplies. Those are all not to be underestimated reprisals. Also excluding Russia from payments SWIFT can be a boomerang. Here's what else. The Dutch people voted away intensive economic and military cooperation with Ukraine in the 2015 referendum on the Association Treaty. We have to stick to that. As already mentioned, BVNL does not want Dutch deaths as a result of a conflict in Ukraine. That's what BVNL stands for. Every politician in this Chamber will have to take personal account of himself. Would the long-term border dispute between Ukraine and Russia be worth the life of my son or daughter if he is in the army and comes home in a bodybag? Will the Secretary of Defense undertake that under no circumstances will she send Dutch soldiers to Ukraine? Another aspect is European geopolitical interests. These aren't here. Europe is not a federal state. We are talking about sovereign states, and that geopolitical integration will never happen in relation to BVNL. Nor is this conflict an argument for forming a European army. BVNL rejects this at all times. Minister Hoekstra said in an interview with Beau that he almost came to the conclusion with shame that Europe is hardly able to defend the continent. I will tell the Minister a little secret: that was already known in 1949. That's why NATO was founded, a wonderful club. It is regrettable that many members, including the Netherlands, do not wish to pay the agreed fee of 2% of GNP. Finally. Of course, BVNL assumes that the cabinet of expensive lessons with regard to the evacuations of Dutch people in Afghanistan has learned. Hopefully this will now lead to a better crisis policy.

16,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u8,"Mr President, thank you. The Cold War has been back from being gone. At the eastern border of Ukraine we see mobilization from Russia. From the West, Ukraine itself is getting more and more military support. The United States, as well as the United Kingdom and many other countries, provide everything: weapons, advisors, trainings. More and more, we are witnessing an unadulterated arms race, which mainly benefits arms producers. The question is, what is wisdom? We have nothing to do with the mobilisation of troops on the border with Ukraine. On the other hand, an unnecessary arms race must be avoided. A solution must be found which is workable for all parties, which guarantees and rejects the sovereignty of states, which ensures collective security, which recognizes Ukraine's concerns, but which is equally aware of Russian concerns regarding NATO enlargement. They didn't start with Putin. Oral promises about not expanding NATO turned out to be a wash. Ignoring the history books in this respect is downright dangerous. We are in favour of disarming and de-escalation in line with previous agreements made in Helsinki and Paris. The OSCE, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, can play a central role in this process. Does the government share that opinion? And can you tell us exactly how the OSCE talks are going? What progress has been made? Can you respond to the leaked American response to Russian demands? It was in the NRC, among other things. In that we actually see some light in terms of disarmament and control of each other's military bases. Can you confirm this? And are you willing to promote this approach? Ukraine wants weapons, but for the time being the government is silent about a concrete delivery. Can the government tell us what the latest state of affairs is? Is the Netherlands going to respond to this request or not? In December, the government considered that arms supplies to Ukraine did not contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. That was wise, but the government has now turned. Now you're sympathetic to an arms deal. As far as the SP is concerned, arms supplies to Ukraine are oil on the fire. Germany says the same thing. It would be good to hang out. I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. Moreover, European rules on arms exports prohibit the supply of arms to conflict zones. Do you agree that supplying weapons is unwise, moreover, against the rules? The Dutch government should take the lead in finding a diplomatic way out. That is my appeal to the government: abandon armament, work on de-escalation of the conflict and look at previous agreements and previous treaties. We have prepared a petition for this, which has just been posted on our website. No war in Europe! That's what needs to be prevented. I also asked for a meeting with the Lower House and people of the OVSG this afternoon to discuss a lasting peace in Europe. 'Cause if we don't talk anymore, Chairman, we're gonna shoot!

22,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u27,"Mr. Chairman. We have talked a lot about Ukraine in recent weeks, but I wonder if we have had the fundamental debate. We talked about whether the Netherlands should now supply arms to Ukraine. Of course solidarity is good, but you may wonder if a Dutch contribution will make the difference on the spot. We talked about whether the travel advice should be changed. I think it is a good thing that we as Dutch people try to be careful and manage, but let us also be careful with micromanagement from the Chamber regarding Dutch and diplomats abroad. I believe that the debate should be about how to change Russia's mind and how to get Putin to talk about our demands. For let us be quite honest: at the moment Putin is just ahead of 1-0 militaryly and politically. He stands before the military with the more than 100,000 soldiers on the north, east and south borders of Ukraine. We've all seen the footage of trains full of military equipment, with tanks. We have read that large stocks of blood have also been brought to the frontline. Politically, Putin has us wherever he wants us to be. It's about his demands. It's about what Ukraine can't do. It must not become a member of NATO. It can't decide for itself what the future looks like. Of course, NATO can't do anything either. NATO must, above all, do nothing and move on to the West. So Putin is actually an angry neighbor throwing garbage in your garden, taking a few rooms off your house, killing your roommate, and then saying to you, ""What concessions are you willing to make to me?"" Mr. Chairman. It should be about our demands: no more deployment of chemical weapons from Russia on the territory of Europe, no more killings in European capitals and no more Russian occupying forces on the border with Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova. Then we can talk about mutual disarmament and confidence-building measures. Putin wants a Yalta 2.0. He wants to go back to the realms of influence. We want a Helsinki 2.0. We want to reaffirm human rights and sovereignty. I ask this cabinet whether it shares that analysis and whether this is our commitment. I believe that much of the letter was still based on Putin's demands and frame rather than on our own demands. Mr. Chairman. Then the key question: how do we reverse this dynamic? First of all, we do this by making the price so high for Putin that the military invasion is not done. It has already been said by previous speakers: European sanctions; they make guesses of what is on the table. That's good. At the same time, there have been sanctions against Russia for years. I ask the cabinet why we believe that sanctions will have effects this time. Secondly, military deterrents through NATO and the East. That's what's happening. The Netherlands also supplies. I ask the Minister of Defence what the steps that have just been taken, but also what possible follow-up steps might be. Thirdly, help to make Ukraine as resilient as possible. If you read the cabinet letter, you can see that we are doing a lot of work on that point. I am curious to see what the cabinet might come up with in the context of arms supplies. Mr. Chairman. But we don't do the most important thing, and that's after Putin's corruption money and the oligarchal clique that supports him. In recent weeks, Putin was completely invisible in the media, until someone in London said: let's take a closer look at the real estate and the black money of those oligarchs here in London. Whoever said that was not the least; he was an important politician. Then it suddenly didn't take Putin so long before he got angry, really furious, on TV. The British slogan was hit Putin through banks, not tanks. So there's his weakness. There's his Achilles heel. We need to press on that. A recent analysis showed that Russian citizens have as much financial assets abroad as they do in Russia. Send that in for a minute. That's why I have the following questions. The European Union has the Magnitsky Act. It helps us to freeze the money of human rights criminals and to ban them from the European Union. I would like to ask the Foreign Minister to argue at the next IAB that corruption should be included in that law and that Putin and his cabal should be on that list so that they can be punished. That is what the debate should be about. Then we hit them where it hurts: in their wallet.

The underlying principle is that a sovereign country can decide for itself whether it looks to the West or the East.

If we give that up, we will give up a central, fundamental principle of sovereignty for Putin's power policy.

Unagreed in the approach, in the setting of borders and in our political and economic response to the outside world. Unity within the European Union and unanimity within NATO. Mr. Chairman. The conflict is taking place in Europe. The US has repeatedly asked the EU to take responsibility for its security in its own region. But the EU is not capable enough. This is how we watch Biden and Putin negotiate the future of our continent. How does the Secretary of State view this? Where do we see this lack of unity in Europe? For example, Orbán's visit to Putin. But also to the emergence of these small bilateral initiatives. Denmark is sending a ship to the Baltic Sea. Spain is sending a ship to the Black Sea. Lithuania is sending her part of the European Cyber Rapid Response Team. And the Netherlands suggests wanting to do the same as Ukraine asks. All good little steps, but not nearly enough to form a fist and to guard order and peace on our continent. Limited European integration, including defence cooperation, prevents a rapid, united European response. Fortunately, NATO now stands on its feet and sends a clear signal to Putin. At the same time, we, or NATO, must also show wisdom and not go for further escalation, so that Putin has the space to organise his retreat. Does the Foreign Minister share this analysis and, if so, what steps does he take with colleagues to prevent and organise escalation? What is the list Ukraine asked for? How does the Netherlands relate to this? And why this way? The following questions are also included. For example, when will the Cyber Team be deployed and how quickly can this team be deployed? Is the mandate only defensive and defensive against cyberattacks, or is the mandate also reactively carrying out cyberattacks on Russian targets at the time of a potential invasion? What other preparations are being made at European level to respond quickly and effectively to an invasion? Does the cabinet also look at the importance of the Ukrainian economy and, if so, how? And how does the cabinet guarantee this? Mr. Chairman. The economic sanction package must be clear. A possible offensive comes at a high price. It is still unclear what the sanction package is and when it will be deployed. How, for example, will Nord Stream 2 become part of this? The letter we received just before the debate states that, if there is a reason for this, the cabinet will endeavour to impose a package of sanctions at European level. Do I understand that there is still a great deal to be said about this and that this is not yet on the table? Mr. Chairman. It is a scenario that we must avoid at all costs, but should the situation escalate, do we have humanitarian aid for the most vulnerable groups in the case of a Russian takeover? Let us stay away from escalating rhetoric which drives up the military display of power and increases the chance of confrontation and let us prepare ourselves in the background for a rapid evacuation, should that be necessary.

28,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u96,"Mr President, thank you. Everyone in our country was first a virus expert, now it's swarming with Russian experts. There's a lot of speculation about an invasion and about Putin's intentions. We're almost being talked into a war, it seems, with war rhetoric and influence from all sides. Fortunately, Ukraine itself says that an attack is not yet imminent at all. Mr. Chairman. If Putin had any intention of going that way, he would not have been shocked by Mr Rutte and Mr Hoekstra. What that duo Ukraine had to offer yesterday were just threatening words about sanctions and a few ICT experts. I ask the Minister: where did they come from? And there was talk of supplies of military goods. The newspapers then show that it is possible about metal detectors and some helmets. Even the terrorists in Syria received more support from the Netherlands in the past. Therefore, save the Netherlands this failure and give nothing, don't give any military goods at all. Ukraine is not a NATO member. We don't owe that country any military assistance at all. In addition, the provision of military equipment can also be seen as an advance towards increased military support in the longer term. That's something we don't want at all. In addition, our own armed forces are not in order either. I'd say work on that first. That is why I would like to call for the plan for arms supplies and military support to be shot down today. A better bet than arms supplies would be to stop the chicken game that is now being played from both sides: both run hard on the abyss and know on both sides of no stopping. I'm asking the cabinet to deploy more diplomacy towards Russia. Please bear in mind that that country does not want to be infected with social decay, as it believes we can see. That's why Putin doesn't want to see integrated into Western alliances and thus Western Ukraine. Let me say to the government that this can be taken into account. Mr. Chairman. Above all, we must prevent Ukraine from being torn apart by Putin and the power politicians from Brussels and Washington. In this respect, the visit of Rutte and Hoekstra to Kiev was a missed opportunity to take away the expectations in Kiev, but also certainly the concerns in Moscow. For example, by conveying the message that Ukraine will not become a NATO and EU member as far as the Netherlands is concerned. And not only, as the government letter states, that it is not on the agenda, but will not be on the agenda either. This is also a message that fits and is more in line with the outcome of the Ukraine referendum of 6 April 2016. I ask the rulers if they have thought of that referendum result at all.

That they are those tens of thousands of Ukrainians who feel compelled to follow training on how to survive an invasion or how to pick up the weapons themselves to protect themselves. The Russian people want the government to deal with their welfare rather than with power politics. International stability is not only in our interest but above all in their interest. These are the people who it should be about. Mr. Chairman. Delivering weapons, however, is oil on the fire. We can see that military armament is increasing, and so there is a risk of more instability and more escalation. Delivering weapons is getting involved in a conflict. The Party for Animals therefore wants everything to be done for de-escalation. For what is NATO going to do if the Ukrainian armed forces, despite arms, are still undermining it? Does the Cabinet consider this scenario? That would be a disaster that couldn't be overlooked. Have further agreements been reached during the Minister's visit on the bilateral request made by Ukraine? And what exactly is that request? In addition to focusing on promoting dialogue and de-escalation, a sanction package is extremely important in replying to Putin. What is the situation with this sanction package, I ask the cabinet. And what is the role of the Netherlands in this? Last year there were even constructive talks between the Netherlands and Russia on Nord Stream 2 and our Prime Minister was still talking about a ""commercial project."" Does the Minister now recognise the great geopolitical interest in Nord Stream 2? Is there therefore a change in the cabinet position? Is he prepared to put an end to this project in the Netherlands as soon as possible? How does the Cabinet view the possibility of sanctioning Russian oligarchs? Mr Sjoerdsma also mentioned this. Putin would be hit in his immediate vicinity. Is this option on the table as far as the cabinet is concerned? And will the cabinet also propose to address the letterbox companies in the Netherlands, as previous speakers have suggested? What is the expected impact of this sanction package on the sanctions that are already in place? Mr. Chairman. This conflict is yet another example of how vulnerable we are to Russian gas dependence. It is important not only for peace and security, but also for the climate and for the Groningen people that we become independent of gas as soon as possible. How's the exit plan coming along?

32,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u118,"Thank you. First of all, welcome to the ministers in this Chamber. I haven't seen them here yet, so welcome on behalf of the BBB. President and inhabitants of the Netherlands. The first words of the Ukrainian national anthem are: Ukraine is not yet lost. These remind me of the story of a Ukrainian mother. A mother who raised her children in the ruins of the Soviet Union. A mother who saw her eldest son leave for the front in Donbas in 2014. A mother who lost her son to ambitions of Russian oligarchs: billionaires who also make millions of investments here on the Zuidas. This mother lives in fear these days, with her only surviving son training in the woods every weekend to defend Ukrainian independence as a reservist. Let us not forget that. Let us not forget that, from our safe plenary room, we are debating geopolitics, sitting in calf-studded chairs, when we have no enemy at our borders. Let's not forget that we talk about people's lives. Mr. Chairman. Ukraine does not belong to NATO, but that does not mean that it is almost as far to Kiev from this plenary room as to Lisbon in Portugal. Closer than you think. The security of Ukraine is therefore important for us. BBB is for a clear position. If we stand by Ukraine, we must say: we prevent war by making the price of an invasion of Russia unacceptable. This means that we must hit Putin's friends, who use our country as a piggy bank, hard financially. In addition, it means that we must support Ukraine in military terms and help to arm Ukraine if necessary. If necessary. The only thing that scares Russia is clarity. Otherwise, it's like turning off wolves with a paper handkerchief. Does the Minister intend to join Poland and the United Kingdom, which clearly state their support for Ukraine? And what about options such as training missions, armament and/or directing frigates? Mr. Chairman. The Russian economy is 50% larger than the Dutch economy. It is a country with a strongly ageing population, and yet they know how to make the whole of Europe tremble again. Why are we so dependent on Russian whims? I would like to hear from the Minister a long-term vision of Russia's strategic independence. As far as BBB is concerned, there are three pillars for this. One: a defence that meets NATO's 2% standard; a defence that can satisfy its constitutional task with confidence; a defence with a strong national reserve. Two: no dependence on Russian gas. Until the completion of the energy transition, we need to look for alternative suppliers. There are. Life under the Russian gas thumb is not sustainable. Then the most important pillar: The Netherlands must never, but never become dependent on countries such as Russia for its food supply. The fact that we can continue to feed our own people with our own farmers is strategically a very great wealth. Don't slaughter this chicken with the golden eggs. Mr. Chairman. I would like to make a proposal to the Members of Parliament. Yesterday, I saw a picture from the Ukrainian Parliament where parliamentarians held up flags of countries supporting Ukraine's sovereignty. The Dutch flag was missing between the great diversity of flags. I've got a flag right here. I suggest taking a picture with the willing Members of Parliament during the suspension, because let us be clear: the Netherlands supports the sovereignty and freedom of the people of Ukraine. As far as BBB is concerned, the position of the Netherlands in the coming weeks is very simple: be an advocate of peace and dialogue, but make it clear that any attack on Ukraine's independence will be a very expensive joke for Putin and his comrades, especially in the economic field.

33,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u120,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At the border between Ukraine and Russia, the threat has increased considerably in recent weeks. It is, in fact, exactly as Mrs van der Plas says: it is almost impossible for us to imagine what that is like. We had a meeting this afternoon with the ambassadors of the Baltic countries. Who described very strikingly what threat they should live with. For us it's still a theoretical story, but for a lot of people it's not and it's about life and death. We need to be well aware of that. Mr. Chairman. Nor should we underestimate the geopolitical impact of this situation. The stability of our own continent, of Europe, is in danger. A threat of escalation, a war, in Ukraine on the borders of the European Union has a major geopolitical impact. We also know all too well in Europe and also in the Netherlands what the Russian threat at the border of Europe can do for us. Think of the disaster with MH17. The situation requires us as the Netherlands in the EU and in NATO to work in unity. This has already been highlighted by a number of people, among others by Mr Dassen. That, I believe, is the core: that unity that we need to monitor and achieve, including in Europe. Only then can we really be an effective block against Putin. We must be clear that the price for Russian aggression will be very high. Mr. Chairman. It remains of great importance in the coming weeks to focus on de-escalation. GroenLinks still believes that a diplomatic exit is possible. We want to make every effort to prevent a Russian raid in Ukraine, but we cannot be naive. We have seen in Crimea and Georgia that Putin does not shy away from a military attack and can act quickly. That is why we need to be well prepared in case the conflict escalates. I am pleased to hear that Prime Minister Rutte and Minister Hoekstra are also aware of this and have travelled to Kiev this week. In light of this meeting, I have a number of questions. Can the Minister first state what was discussed with President Zelenski yesterday? What is the exact question of support that Ukraine put to the Netherlands in its request for aid two weeks ago? To what extent does it deviate from the question of support that has been put to the European Union? Can the Minister specify what he means by ""support for cybersecurity"" offered to Ukraine? What exactly are we talking about? The Minister says in Trouw: we have a lot of expertise in that area and if we can help, we are available. It's not clear to me how we're gonna help. Mr. Chairman. In order to prevent Russia from attacking, it is important to have a strong sanction package ready; a number of colleagues have already mentioned this. GroenLinks considers it important to reach agreement on this at European level. As far as we are concerned, SWIFT's banking system, its decoupling and Nord Stream 2 are also explicitly on the table. We also consider it important to see how we can hit Putin by imposing sanctions against the oligarchs on Putin's side. I have some questions about the status of the possible sanction package. Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister to what extent there is now agreement at European level on the sanctions to be introduced. Second. Does the Netherlands or Europe have a list of Putin's inner circle, against which we can impose additional sanctions? And if so, what sanctions does the Minister consider most effective against this group? Third. How does the Minister intend to engage in the reinforced sanction unit that my colleague, Mr Van der Lee, has worked hard for? Finally. We can, of course, argue for all kinds of sanctions, but in the meantime, I have already said it in an interruption debate with Mr Sjoerdsma, because of our very favourable tax climate, the cream de la crème of the Russian industry in the Netherlands. To name a few: Yandex, a large Russian internet giant, a search engine, department store and transport platform; natural gas giant Gazprom; oil company Rosneft. And that also applies to hundreds of other Russian companies. My question is: what does this cabinet want to do to meet them? Is the Cabinet prepared to take action? Mr. Chairman. I agree with the concerns expressed by Mr Brekelmans about the Dutch who are in Ukraine. In conclusion, I would like to stress once again that Europe must act as united as possible, because that is how we can be effective. If we don't watch our backs, we're gonna be a joke in international politics.

34,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u127,"Mr. Chairman. Fortunately, the crisis in Ukraine is being discussed more intensively among many Heads of Government. That's a good sign. It means that diplomacy can prevail over the military aspect. I welcome the Foreign Minister back from Kiev. I hope he had a good talk there and said: Ukraine... British Prime Minister Johnson preceded him, as did the Polish Prime Minister. The Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán visited President Putin in Moscow, who again called the French President Macron. Mr Erdogan is also looking for a way in that whole thing. But talking is better than shooting. It is also important for the United States to talk to Russia. A Russian leader, whoever he is, always sees himself as the strong man when he talks to another strong man, to the American President. Unfortunately, a strong woman doesn't appear in that story yet. This is about power politics. Moscow has a focus on the United States. In Europe Putin is playing cat and mouse with the different countries, which are divided and are also divided. What is needed now is a negotiating platform and a series of negotiating points. It is about arms control, such as the position of medium-range missiles, and also about Ukraine's position. The enlargement of NATO after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 reached the border of that process. That border is Ukraine. Literally, Ukraine means ""on the edge."" That's it. This leads to tensions with Russia. Former VVD leader Frits Bolkestein saw that first. He argued in the Lower House in 1997 for that very reason against the extension of NATO. In 2008, NATO wanted to put Ukraine and Georgia on the path to NATO membership. That was a mistake, according to former Secretary General of NATO Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in 2018. 'Cause the tensions immediately re-emerged. We need to learn from those lessons. JA21 believes that the Netherlands should not focus on arms supplies, and certainly not on sending troops to Ukraine. We must use this momentum of diplomacy. Does the Minister agree? JA21 wants to de-escalate the situation. I do not think it would help if the government were to wave the idea of sending weapons. What is admissible and useful is the help to increase Ukraine's cyber protection, especially by countering cyber attacks. I can wholeheartedly support that. The only thing the Netherlands can decide at EU level is a sanction package against Russia in the event of an invasion. It will be a deterrent, but it is also a double-edged sword. I am convinced that Moscow will immediately turn off the gas tap to the West. Energy prices will explode and the Netherlands will be in the cold. Inflation in the Netherlands is already 7.6%, a record high. It hasn't been this high in years. Further price increases are a major problem for many households in the Netherlands. I do not have to explain this to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was Minister of Finance for this matter. Let me conclude with a Russian saying, but in Dutch: anyone who risks nothing does not drink champagne. I hope no one's risking anything and after that we can still drink champagne.

35,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u131,"Mr. Chairman. Last week I was in Kiev. Not to warn the Russians for the last time or to promise Ukraine weapons, none of that is up to me. As a Dutch representative, I was there together with Chief Rabbi Jacobs for a very different purpose: to commemorate the Holocaust. A Holocaust who in Kiev got a horrible face through bullets and mass executions. In 1941, nearly 34,000 Jews were openly shot by the Nazis in two days by the Babi Jar ravine. It was a terrible bloodbath. As with the dead bodies, ""sand over"" was literally the motto, then in a figuratively sense it also happened in the Soviet Union. The complete killing of the Jewish population of Kiev was silenced. A survivor told me last week how he had kept quiet for 60 years. If he spoke of it, it would also become clear that he is Jewish. It indicates how history matters and how we must continue to fight against evil, including the evil of anti-Semitism. It also shows how it is too easy to classify the world around us in black and white, in heroes and villains, in good and wrong countries. I was reminded of a quote by the Russian writer and Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: the dividing line between good and evil runs not between races, classes, countries and peoples, but through every human heart. This does not mean that we must therefore remain silent in this conflict. No, we also have behaviour of countries to check against what is right and fair, against the international legal order. Russia has already crossed the line with Crimea and is now again firmly searching for the borders, literally and figuratively, not to mention that one terrible event: the taking down of the MH17, with so many Dutch victims as a result. Other countries, the European Union, the Netherlands, are challenged to set clear borders and guard borders. The sovereign state of Ukraine, on the same European continent as we live on, deserves our support and protection. First and foremost, it is desirable to continue to work with perseverance and tact, with backbone, on diplomacy to resolve points of conflict and to safeguard our interests. However, the SGP is also in favour of credible deterrents, which may include military reinforcement and economic sanctions. It has already been said a great deal today, and I repeat to my fellow Members that the price of Russian aggression must be made as high as possible. A good deterrent is important and can prevent bloodshed. Mr. Chairman. Prime Minister Rutte and Minister Hoekstra were in Kiev this week and spoke with President Zelenski among others. What could they actually offer, I wondered, when it comes to military support. Given the state of our armed forces, that could never have been much. I wasn't there, so I don't know how the conversation went. But it could have gone like this: ""Dear President, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, we have undressed and outdone our armed forces in a victorious rod. As a result of the occupation of Crimea, we have gradually lost sight of the issue and the cabinet sees that we really need to invest more in our defence. However, at the moment, to be honest, in the Netherlands we have more ministers than tanks, to name but one example."" That is why the question remains as to whether, in this new threat too, the rulers will see a reason for strengthening our armed forces without delay and for keeping other countries and ourselves to move towards the 2% standard as quickly as possible, as it has been agreed.

As I see it, there has often been a great deal of consensus on major issues, such as the international legal order, the security of Europe, and a number of other matters. I found that very pleasant to notice, because it is sometimes less united. I would like to do it from the cabinet's side as follows. I shall make a few introductory remarks myself. After that, I will be the first to comment on political and diplomatic developments. Then I'm gonna talk about sanctions. The fourth block is about the arms request, the security of the post and the Dutch on the spot. The fifth block is a very richly arranged block ""other,"" because there are quite a lot of questions that were asked that could not logically be taken into account in one of the other four parts. The Secretary of Defense will, of course, go into the technical side of the arms request, the more technical side of the cyber request and, of course, everything that affects developments in NATO and the military. Mr. Chairman. Let me start by repeating once again, and I very much agree with almost all the groups that have said that we are very concerned about what is going on at the borders of Ukraine. There is a very strong build-up of troops that goes far beyond normal. That is why there are not only great concerns in Ukraine, but also in the international community. Some speakers, such as Mr Brekelmans and others, have pointed out that this pattern is still going on. What I would like to say first of all at the beginning of this debate is that the best card we have and the commitment I would far prefer is that we should be able to reach it through dialogue in the various formats. This is, of course, through direct dialogue between the United States and Russia. This is obviously due to many bilateral contacts that certainly the larger countries, but also a number of other countries, have with Russia. That is always, rightly so, in very close consultation with Ukraine. And that's through the so-called Normandy Format. That is very important, because it brings Germany and France to the table, and with that, in my view, the European Union is de facto also at the table. That too is very important, especially because the European Union is right to be concerned and is right to look for a role in this situation. All in all, this is by far the best card we can play. At the same time, and we discussed this with each other in the AA, this is the time when you have to point out that if diplomacy does not succeed, it must have major consequences. Mr Sjoerdsma and Mrs Mulder said that and others pointed out that. 'Cause this is really about a head case. It's about the integrity of another country. One of the lessons that history has taught us is that you have to work very carefully in front of it and that it is an extremely bad idea to be indulgent in it and to think that they are just minor violations of the integrity of a country, then accept it and think that that is the recipe with which you can stop the bleeding.

I have a vague suspicion that we will come across this misunderstanding again in another debate. Mr. Chairman. Mrs Piri rightly pointed out the following. Arms supplies are always sensitive. We're willing to look into it. It's about defensive weapons. She said, ""How are we supposed to read that?"" I tried to indicate that in the letter. There too, I have simply wanted to be transparent. There are weapons that are clearly defensive. There are also weapons that are clearly offensive. But of course there are a lot of weapons that can be used for both purposes. So you can't always rule out the use of an offensive weapon that gives you primary defense. But let's be honest. Are we now concerned about a large-scale attack by Ukraine on Russia? I don't believe it. It is only about a country that is under great, great pressure, where more than 100,000 soldiers are on the border from a country that has a formidable military force. That country is asking the Netherlands and other countries: can you help us with the basic right to defend ourselves? That is the question before us.

Quite frankly, I think there are always two things in such a package at the same time. One is whether you can help in the short and longer term in the military sense. We all understand that, in a conflict, things that are directly useful to people who are already trained to use those things are of direct benefit. You also have things to do with, for example, a training mission. That'll do you some good, but not in a conflict in the short term. You just need a long time to do that.

That is precisely why they say that even those things that we cannot use tomorrow have value, because that certainly strengthens our position in the longer term.

44,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u316,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you also to Members for their input and their questions. I want to structure my response along four lines. One. The security situation. Two. NATO. Three. The EU, where I also bring cyber. Four. The resilience of Ukraine and cooperation. Mr. Chairman. The security situation. It has been said many times today, but I would also like to underline it, because it is of course extremely worrying. It is high on our agenda and also high on the agenda of my colleagues in NATO and the EU, as well as in bilateral contacts. I would also like to emphasise that the most important weapon we have is our unity: the unity of allies, the unity of the EU. That is why this good cooperation and all the contacts we have over and over again are crucial. There's a lot of work going on right now. Since September last year, we have seen that unusual and very extensive troop-building in Ukraine. I say that explicitly: unusual. Mr. Brekelmans asked for that too. Based on these capabilities, a Russian military operation is possible. In fact, that could also happen with a really short response period. That is our assessment of the current situation. We must also remember that Russia also has a wide range of hybrid instruments. Those are instruments other than the structure we see. These are cyber, the means of influence and the economic resources they have. So it's even more than what we see in troop building. Unfortunately, the dialogue that has taken place so far has not yet led to a change in this attitude, which can only be described as aggressive. Now it is not the case that if the discussions do not produce results or come to an end, they automatically lead to military action. That's not law enforcement either. At the moment, our image - and that is also the international image - is that Russia has not yet taken a decision on it. So talking is incredibly important. That is the trail, as my colleague has just said, of diplomacy, of dialogue and of de-escalation. As I said, the defence ministers in the EU and in NATO have a lot of contact. We, too, are doing this with the aim of de-escalating. The Netherlands is committed to this and plays its part in it. I believe that we can play an important role in this. This is also reflected in the contacts I have had with all EU colleagues in the informal RBZ Council and in the bilateral contacts I already had with the German, French and British colleagues and with NATO's sg. Next week, I'm gonna keep doing that. I will continue to talk in Berlin with the German colleague and with NATO's sg in Brussels. The next week is the NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels. There will also be a debate in this Chamber next week. So there are many times when we can reflect on the latest developments. But the most important thing, of course, is that we all send the same message to Russia through that consultation. There is a possibility of de-escalating through consultation and dialogue. If that does not work and if Russia decides on an incursion from Ukraine, in any form whatsoever, Russia will pay the high price that has been mentioned here this afternoon and this evening, by Mrs Piri, Mr Dassen and many others. Then NATO. It is, of course, incredibly important to be prepared for scenarios in which these conversations yield nothing. It is for this reason that we have a two-track policy, namely dialogue and also deterrent and defence. NATO is primarily committed to this. NATO is prepared for all kinds of scenarios, where the alliance is also in favour of the alliance, but is now taking further steps, given the topicality, to see whether the security of the allies is sufficiently guaranteed. This means that NATO brings the existing, rapidly deployable reaction forces that we have to the full and that all all allies are asked to make available and fill the capabilities for the so-called Enhanced NATO Response Force. We are. That's what the Netherlands does. I have informed the Chamber of, for example, those two F-35 fighter planes that we are going to deploy, operational for the first time. I have informed the Chamber of the additional vessel deployed for the standing NATO fleet in northern Europe, the amphibious for transport. Would anyone then suggest... The debate this afternoon, of course, was about how that should be interpreted. Can you interpret that as an escalation? That is not, of course, the case. The defensive alliance that is NATO does its job, does its duty. So that is not something Russia has something to fear. However, it is a signal in times of rising tension that NATO looks, analyses and considers what is needed to protect the territory of NATO's fellow members. I think it is crucial that we, as NATO, make it clear that we are able to defend ourselves against aggressiveness and intimidation if they are directed against the alliance. So this is about deterrent and defense. This is, of course, also an explicit aim to ensure that Russia refrains from any form of aggression, including against Ukraine. In fact, this is precisely what Putin does not want, namely that NATO should strengthen itself. That's actually an undesirable effect, from Putin's perspective. This also helps these NATO actions as a form of deterrent against aggression against Ukraine. One was a number of specific questions about NATO, or related to NATO. Mr Ephraim of the Van Haga Group asked: could it be that Dutch soldiers are going to Ukraine? I would like to add a few words myself: whether or not it is in the NATO context. No Dutch soldiers are being deployed to defend Ukraine, because Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Article 5, the obligation to provide assistance, is therefore not triggered. Ukraine is a close partner of NATO. Our commitment is to assist Ukraine from NATO, from the EU, and also bilaterally, on which I will return shortly. Ukraine is a sovereign country and has the right to self-defense. I should like to come to the bilateral requests that lie before us, and to ask whether training aspects might be included. But it is not a matter of bringing Dutch units into Ukrainian territory under Article 5. Mr Brekelmans asked about specific options that NATO is looking at. I thought he mentioned Romania. Mr Sjoerdsma asked more generally what NATO is actually doing and what scenarios are being developed. Of course, different action options will be developed. It's not one option, but it's multiple options. I can't share with the Chamber exactly what they are right now. Perhaps it is a good thing to say, also because it has been emphasised by the sg of NATO, that NATO is preparing for the possibility that it is necessary to expand those ally units, should the situation so request. So at the moment we are still talking about filling up the capacities that were already foreseen, but of course we are also making scenarios where more is needed. If that is the case, the Netherlands will, of course, talk about it. We will therefore have to assess any requests. It is not yet that far, but it is important to know that NATO does. There was a specific question from Mrs Mulder on Baltic Air Police. This is indeed an existing link to which the Netherlands has also participated in the past with F-16's. I believe that was in 2017. It's just being filled on a rotational basis, I'll say. It's also being reinforced. At present it is foreseen that the United States and the Danes, among others, will contribute to this. The slots are filled. If there is still a need for this in the future, we will always consider it very seriously. At the moment, this is not the case with us as a specific request. That reinforcement is there, but it is currently being filled by other countries.",True,0.033,0.89,0.077,0.9948,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 46, Session 12 (2022-02-03)",2022-02-03,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 12,Meeting 46,Sitting 2022-02-03,-,COVID,English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,2

46,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-03-tweedekamer-12.u321,"Yes, I understand Mrs Mulder's concern about the Baltic states. I also heard this concern from colleagues from the Baltic States when we met in France a few weeks ago. That makes sense, because if you look at the history of the Baltic states, you can imagine anything. We are of course active in Lithuania with the enhanced Forward Presence. We are therefore well placed to deal with the situation on the ground. Again, the information I have on the Baltic Air Policing, I have just shared with the Chamber. If Mrs Mulder has any other information on this matter, I would be glad to hear it. But here's what I know now about how it went down. Once again, the entire Balticum has a lot of attention, also through our presence in Lithuania. Mr. Chairman. Finally, Mr Van der Staaij's more general question on NATO. He stresses that it is important to strengthen our armed forces. He also mentioned the 2% we agreed on in NATO. I agree with him. Given the deteriorating international security situation, I think it is very good that we increase defence expenditure in the Netherlands. I noticed that the EU and NATO could also count on a very positive approach, if I may put it that way. We're gonna invest a lot. We are talking about 10.7 billion in the coalition agreement in the coming period. There is a structural additional 3 billion per year and that means that we, as the Netherlands, are really making a big step. We therefore expect to reach the EU average by 2024. This is a major step and we have come to the same level as our main European allies. We think we're gonna be around 1.88. And this too is all explainable from the past. But the coalition parties have, of course, consciously taken this step. I see it as a major task that I have, together with the Secretary of State for Defence, to use the resources that exist and which are also desperately needed in the best possible way for the reinforcement, renewal and improvement of our armed forces. Then there is the EU and a number of issues about the EU. The EU has already done a number of things in the direction of Ukraine. For example, we have this European Peace Facility, the European Peace Facility, from which things can be financed. You're talking about military-medical capacity, logistical resources, cyber capacity, for example. That is a source of funding that had already been used. In other cases too, we had already sought cooperation with Ukraine. For example, Ukraine would like to modernise and reform its military education system. There's still a bit of a search for the best way to do that. This can be done, for example, from the fund. You could set up a training mission for that. I don't really care. I would say: let's just quickly reach a consensus on this so that it can start. These are, of course, not short-term issues, but they are considered important by Ukraine, and they are issues with which you can improve and strengthen cooperation. When it comes to cyber, I'm just linking it to the EU. For starters, these cyber attacks are just happening. We've seen it happen. It is, of course, unacceptable for a country to suffer such attacks. I also fear that, given the current tensions between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, these cyber attacks could become even more serious, and could result in real destabilisation or even an escalating impact. It is therefore very good and very logical that in the contacts we have with Ukraine in the Netherlands, too, there is talk of possibilities of assistance in this area. Moreover, when these cyber attacks took place, the EU offered to help directly. We have a so-called Cyber Rapid Response Team with a number of countries, of which the Netherlands is part. That was immediately offered by the High Representative to Ukraine. That too is with a defensive aim, in order to prevent such attacks. The Dutch participation in that project is also a good opportunity to make a concrete contribution to this. It is true that the offer is there, but Ukraine has not yet activated it, I will say. They know. They know about the EU and they know from the Netherlands that we are willing to provide that kind of expertise and we think that we could make a serious contribution.

This team consists of a number of countries, including the Netherlands and a number of other European countries. Especially in the cyber world, it is not necessarily necessary to be on the ground. I did not say that, but it is good that Mr De Roon is asking for it. Then I'll straighten that out. Mr. Chairman. Then there is the final issue: Ukraine's resilience and our cooperation with Ukraine. I think it is important to show solidarity to Ukraine, which I have also tasted today in a large part of the Chamber. The reason for the fellow Members' visit and the reason to speak about this is that we think it is important to assist Ukraine at a difficult time. Of course, Ukraine also has the right to self-defense, as I have just said. I have just outlined how we do this in the NATO context. Even within NATO, the sg has said: we need to see how we can support Ukraine. Ukraine is a partner of NATO. The fact that we say that to each other and actually do so, in my opinion, contributes to the effect that we want to achieve, namely deterrents. This will contribute to destabilization. And that is meant to prevent a military conflict and bloodshed in the end. I would like to repeat it to Mr Van der Staaij. In other words, we must support Ukraine where we can. The cabinet informed the Chamber in the committee debate, where Mr Hoekstra and I were both, that Ukraine had indeed made a request for military goods. We've taken that request into consideration. Of course, we do that very carefully. Mr Hoekstra has just said a few words about this. It must, of course, be part of the larger picture; that is important to emphasise here. It is not the case that Ukraine's request for military goods in itself is already making a huge contribution. What I think is important is that Ukraine has asked for this and that we are just looking very seriously and carefully at the possibilities. I cannot say much about this at the moment. It is also too early to draw conclusions. The process that needs to be completed is just, I think, well described. I should like to add just one thing to what Mr Hoekstra has just said. It also connects a little bit with what De Roon just said. A little depending on the type of material it might be that people should also know how to handle it. In other words, it also requires a form of training. But that too is a consideration that we will make and which we will, of course, share with the Chamber at the end of that process if it leads to a positive reaction. Finally, Mr President. No, sorry, it's not quite finished yet. I have a few more questions back there. We're doing everything we can with Ukraine. Military cooperation also comes in a context in which we have already given support in the past, for example for mine-mining, for safe ammunition storage. I also mention medical aid to injured military personnel and the important contribution we have made and continue to make. I mentioned education. There are also many forms of cooperation between institutions. The Military Rehabilitation Centre in Doorn, which is doing a very good job, may I mention it specifically. I should like to go into a few more details on the basis of a number of questions. What exactly can we do? Mrs Mulder, for example, asked. Others, too. I told you, it's a careful process. We need to test it. The question with us, with the Defense Department, is of course: what exactly is it, do we have it, could we deliver it? In other words: is it something we can miss for a while? 'Cause, yeah, you have to take that into account, too. Of course, the readiness, the employability, of the Dutch armed forces also plays a role in this. So yes, that's taken into account. And the inventory is running. Is there anything else we can do? That was, I believe, Mr Sjoerdsma's question. Mrs van der Plas mentioned a number of specific things. She was talking about training missions and armament and she was also talking about frigates: could we do that? I would like to say this: let us not all look through the straw of that request at the conflict that may arise between Ukraine and Russia. It's a lot more than that. Everything I have just said, for example, about how we act in NATO, and everything we can show as Europe by radiating unity: that is really what this is really about. Once again, out of solidarity, because we are really very worried and because we think that a country simply has the right to defend itself, we are going to look at this very seriously. But in the context of expectations management I thought: let me give this profit warning. Mr. Chairman.

What gave me concern was the answers to the sanction package. It seems to be a long time before the European sanction package arrives. I would urge the Minister to emphasise the urgency of this in the European Union. The same applies to the supply of weapons. There was talk in a few weeks. It is precisely if we want a deterrent effect, both in terms of sanctions and in terms of the supply of defensive weapons, that it is important that we proceed with urgency. I welcomed the Minister's commitment to continue his efforts to inform the Dutch in Ukraine as much as possible. I would like to ask him to send a brief letter for the next RBZ on how far that has worked and how far he has managed to reach more Dutch people.

There are no major differences between the efforts of the cabinet and my group in this area. We share the analysis of the threat and we also share the willingness to work alongside diplomacy on all possible aspects of deterrents. However, I am genuinely concerned about the speed and consensus within the EU in order to bring about serious deterrents. Without any deterrent, I consider the chances of diplomatic success a lot less. The danger is that, in the event of a major military attack by Russia, that consensus can still be found, but at the moment when it remains bullying, threatening, green males and hybrid threats, I think we are either paralyzed or totally divided. Despite the fact that a number of parties here in the Chamber do not want to support support Ukraine and the deterrent and call for a diplomatic solution, I would also like to say that a diplomatic solution that results in us being divided back into spheres of influence in Europe is equally catastrophic. My appeal to the cabinet: keep your back straight! Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political analyst, wrote a beautiful piece in the New York Times today.

As far as the EU is concerned, the PVV certainly does not think so, but also within NATO, we do not think that unity is the most important thing. The most important thing is that our government keeps our country out of a war, which does not concern us. Above all, this must remain so and that our government does nothing that can be interpreted in such a war as supporting one of the parties. Specifically, this means for the PVV: no NATO membership for Ukraine, no money from the Dutch taxpayer to corrupt Ukraine and no supply of military equipment and Dutch military support to Ukraine.

I have one more question. I think it was said that we are not sending soldiers to Ukraine, but Minister Ollongren indicated that people might be needed to teach Ukrainian colleagues how to handle the equipment. I wonder whether that takes place in Ukraine and whether it is military and, if so, whether it does not mean de facto Dutch military presence in Ukraine. Perhaps it is late, perhaps I misunderstood, but I would like to have some clarification on this. The position of the cabinet is that it looks favourably at the request, but that it is not a question of military presence. At the same time, if they have to prepare equipment and train other soldiers, this is de facto the case. So I'd like to get some clarity on that.

Finally, I also said about that same cyber training team that that does not necessarily mean that that team should also go to Ukraine, because it can also take place from a distance.

60,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-08-eerstekamer-11.u157,"This is a key question which I believe we must address in the context of the recovery that we must make in the wake of this terrible affair. This is, among other things, about the quality of legislation. I will return to Mr Van Rooijen's question in a moment. But it is also about applying the principle of proportionality in the General Administrative Law Act, where you can also weigh unfair outcomes differently. It is, of course, also about the commitment we now have to identify hard spots in legislation. Detecting harshness in legislation happens at the end of the journey, but that will teach us to analyse what we can do better at the beginning of legislation. This requires not only to have very good legislative quality, but also to make sure that legislation, policy and practice are really in the same place. Let me put it this way: as a military man, I've always learned that if you make a plan for a military operation, you can throw that plan in the trash after crossing the starting line, because practice never adheres to your plan. This is without prejudice to the fact that, precisely from our responsibility as legislators, we must ensure that we not only have the legislation in place and have the policy in place, but also know how to measure and assess the effects on practice in advance. One of the things that I am currently working on as a minister is an implementation test, including on the legislation of local authorities, to check at the front whether what is happening is ultimately feasible with the means, instruments and powers that go with it. This is a small example in a broader process that we have to go through with each other, but this is to give an idea of it. This also gives me the opportunity to respond directly to Mr Backer's good question and Mr Van Rooijen's justified question, namely: work on this quality of legislation. Yeah, they're really working on it right now. We are working to further strengthen legislative quality, with simplicity, human size and feasibility at the forefront. That is a portfolio that the Minister for Legal Protection and the Minister for Justice and Security are currently picking up. This is about further strengthening the quality of policies and legislation along different lines that apply to them. It is essential that this is not only done, but that, as I have just said, we also look at injustices and harshness in legislation at the moment. We are in the process of setting up a consultation that will be published one of these days. In doing so, people can indicate where legislation is unlawful in advance and where repair should take place. Of course, all state powers have a role to play in this. Mr Van Rooijen said the same thing. It's not just the legislator. It's also the Public Prosecutor's Office and the justice system. They are also in the process of reflecting on themselves. I would also like to say to Mr Van Rooijen that it is simply important to discuss this with each other. With the Minister for Legal Protection, I am in the process of discussing the General Administrative Law Act and, however we look at it, whether we can make the ""citizen-oriented', which is being said, a more human-oriented word and better apply the principle of proportionality there. The question is whether this hardness clause becomes the panacea for all solutions. No, he should never be. The hardness clause must sometimes be in a law. It is intended in the case where a just law has unjust outcomes for those to whom the law relates. A hardness clause in its nature is always an ultimatum remedium. If you have to apply a hardness clause very often in a law, you have to ask yourself after a few times whether you have made the right law. The function of a hardness clause is not to make unjust outcomes unrighteous for those affected by that law. At the same time, if you need a hardness clause very often, you may also conclude that there is something wrong with the law and there is something wrong with the policy. Then you'll have to take on your role as legislator and policymaker again to fix that. That, as I said to the President, is the shaky balance in the democratic rule of law, which Mr Koole has just mentioned. It is also a question of taking things up when you see that they are not going well and perhaps leave more discretion in some legislation in order to arrive at a proper balance.",True,0.043,0.868,0.088,0.9902,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-08-eerstekamer-11,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 16, Session 11 (2022-02-08)",2022-02-08,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 11,Meeting 16,Sitting 2022-02-08,-,COVID,English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,HankeBruinsSlot,"Bruins Slot, Hanke",F,1977,45.0,True,2
61,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-08-eerstekamer-11.u312,"Mr. Chairman. It is always good to do the utmost to provide Mr Van Rooij with answers. Once again, I really wanted to point out that, as far as I am concerned, it might have been obvious not to go into it, given the nature of the debate. But I also understand that this is very important. It's something I do every day in the first place. It is also the reason why the Prime Minister and I went to Ukraine last week. And I can also say that it controls almost all the phone calls and physical conversations I have with colleagues. That is, of course, because we are very concerned about what is going on at the border of Ukraine. In addition, it is very important to mark this again, in the light of some of Mr Van Rooijen's questions, too, that this really is not a kind of situation where two parties would be guilty of the use of warlike texts, and not a situation where there are two quarrels and there are actually two faults. There's really something else going on here. NATO is a defensive alliance. NATO borders, contrary to what Russia claims, but to a very limited part of Russia's territory. NATO is only in favour of providing mutual assistance if one of the Member States is at war. Nor has NATO forced any of the present Member States to join NATO. The latter has been suggested. That was not suggested by Mr Van Rooijen, I repeat. It is so important to highlight this because, of course, these are suggestions that are constantly being made on the Russian side. And they don't add up. It is essential that we also have this debate in the right context. It has been Russia that has not only undertaken to occupy Crimea in violation of international law and to wage war in the east of Ukraine, but it is now also Russia that has joined more than 100,000 soldiers at the border of Ukraine. This concerns both the border between Russia and Ukraine and the border between Belarus and Ukraine. All this does not alter the fact that, although this is extremely worrying, the Dutch cabinet's efforts are primarily aimed at finding a solution through diplomacy. But at this stage, too, this must be accompanied by the articulation of the consequences that we are prepared to attach to any aggression; that is the next point of Van Rooijen, which I very much agree with. It must be clear in advance that things that are detrimental to the integrity of Ukraine's territory have major consequences, that they have major repercussions, from the European Union and from NATO. This is about something so essential that it not only affects the people of Ukraine itself, but also affects stability and security throughout our continent. Mr. Chairman. Mr Van Rooijen further asked about my impressions during the visit last week. I will see to it that the letter of approval of a number of pages, which goes into detail, lands here too. He also asked about contacts with allies. Actually, they're in line with what I just described. I also agree that you should always try to de-escalate through diplomacy, through talking, despite great concern and despite the need on the front for aggression to have consequences, including in the area of sanctions. The cabinet is committed to this, but of course some of the geopolitical key players are also committed to this. The United States does. France and Germany do so through the so-called Normandy format. The European Union is also at the table, not just in the courts, but de facto. There are also a lot of bilateral contacts, as we can all see in the media. Mr. Chairman. Then I have answered many of Mr Van Rooijen's questions. His question concerning the combination of military determination, remaining in conversation and de-escalation I think I have just answered. Mr Van Rooijen made another fifth point. He asked about the German approach. As always, we are very close to Germany here. By the way, I would add in one breath, also with France, also with the United Kingdom, including, of course, the United States, Canada and, as far as I am concerned, all the other Member States of the European Union. This means that, in Europe and with NATO Member States, we are looking at, if necessary, a very substantial package of sanctions. That's one. We are looking with an open eye at the request we have received from Ukraine regarding support in the field of defensive weapons. That's two. Three. If there were such a request for help in the field of cyber........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ Four. That is the last of them: a possible training mission is also being discussed at European level. Of course, this is not something that will solve Ukraine's security problems in the short term. That is more useful in the long term, but it is also an important signal. That's about the whole package. Of course I have very close contact with my German colleague Annalena Baerbock. Mr. Chairman.

63,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-15-eerstekamer-7.u2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me make a comment before I begin my speech. It is always a form of courtesy to welcome a new government. However, three of the four ministers sitting behind the government table have already indicated, before the elections, that among other things, the PVV should be excluded from the coalition negotiations. Ministers undermine democracy and put 1 million voters in the corner. You'll understand that doesn't make the PVV so hot. Mr. Chairman. Let me begin my speech. They're back. Back from never leaving. A motion of censure on your pants: who cares? Just be a little missionary, lie a little bit and cheat and shut out, and before you know it, you'll be comfortable in the Tower again. A function elsewhere was more for the twelve directors who had collapsed during the previous ride, had fallen by the basket or just got a nice job elsewhere. There were even opportunists who accepted smooth positions in the area of their ministership. At such a time, there seems to be no integrity rules and self-interest prevails. That's how you see it: they obviously don't do it for someone else. Those who did come to terms with her conscience and then spoke the truth, were exonerated. Mr. Chairman. Now you'd think: maybe the new team is a little fresher. But how fresh is it if you just make someone minister who previously as Secretary of State committed serious crimes by asylum seekers, covered up in a report, or someone who waved the scepter over the army and blundered a ""function elsewhere"" note and threatened to declare the Republic of Amsterdam if the PVV had too much influence on the government? You will only be sent as a military officer under such a confused minister on a dangerous mission. One has holes in his memories and another reports with holes in his passport at the polling station, which then receives the important file Wonen. Chances are this minister's place under the sun will remain music for the future, at least if you're not a lucky seeker. Of these, tens of thousands are eager to vacate our welfare state, to involve our homes with priority and then to terrorize our villages and cities. All this is facilitated and promoted not only by the asylum industry and the media, but also by the new Secretary of State Van der Burg. He indicated earlier: the more asylum seekers, the better. I would like to hear from the Prime Minister whether the cabinet supports this statement. I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. The Netherlands had a tradition of strong finance ministers, regardless of the colour of the party. But with the D66 wokewappies, traditions are an abomination. Under the rainbow, it's gonna shove common sense. If your gender becomes more important than your professional knowledge, the second most important ministerial post can just be placed with someone who, against better knowledge, has previously sat around the table with the Taliban, has warned the STUDY, has little with the Public Administration Act, tends to muzzle MPs, but is female. Well, that's what I'm talking about. This minister talks with the Taliban about women's rights, but transforms into a banner carrier of Islam, complete with veil, as soon as an ayatollah appears. So you see: under pressure everything becomes liquid. The VVD also leaves its traditions. This party, which first proudly called itself the party of law and order, did not jonaste the convicted terrorist Soumaya Sahla out of the country. Now it may be that they were too busy with the Justice Department prosecuting Wilders, who she would be walking in the footsteps. The VVD gave Soumaya Sahla the VVD membership and promoted her as a national security advisor, a member of the Hofstadgroep, a member of the VVD. A convict for preparing a terrorist attack and illegal possession of weapons became an advisor to national security. The Hofstad group was after Theo van Gogh on the hunt for more victims. Soumaya Sahla and her teammates drove around with, among other things, a loaded automatic weapon. They also found Wilders getting in the way. The appointment of Soumaya Sahla within the VVD was a mesjogge. Imagine the American president getting an advisor from Tora Bora's caves. But fair is fair, there is no denying that Soumaya Sahla does have practical experience. Mr. Chairman. Tough language isn't the VVD weird. ISIS women should stay in the sandbox and be tried there. The current Minister of Justice tweeted about IS women, I quote: ""Good. Consciously chose to travel to IS area. They may still pose a major threat to the Netherlands. We do not want them back here and as far as we are concerned they have lost the right to Dutch citizenship. Judge there."" To my amazement, this minister still collected five IS women from Syria during the honeymoon of the cabinet. One of these jihadbrides would also be Nawal H., a former member of the ""Hofstadgroep"" (Hofstadgroep). How many more jihad brides is this cabinet gonna pick up? I'd like a response from the Prime Minister. Mr. Chairman. While Rutte himself once had strong criticism of a PvdA executive with a dual nationality, he now puts forward the Minister of Justice and Security himself, who is subject to Turkish law. She indicated that she fled Turkey 40 years ago from the military dictatorship. It is incomprehensible that she does not escape the long arm of the dictator Erdogan by giving up her Turkish nationality. You may wonder how she is going to enforce law and security under the Turkish sphere of influence here. But yes, it's all about good intentions and intentions. Just like the coalition chord: nice and vague, full of intentions and without concrete goals and foundations. Yes, because you should not be able to be paid for, when, for example, teachers, people in care, farmers, SMEs have to be held accountable in full detail and paid mercilessly if a tick is not in order. If a dubious, opaque calculation model spits out the politically desired data, you may just have to close your tent. For example, the middle class is increasingly debilitated by disproportionate and dazzling corona measures. This cabinet lets the catering industry breathe economically through a straw until it is exhausted and collapses. This will also have a major impact on the subcontractors. The only ones that get better are the big guys like Amazon. Mr. Chairman. Farmers are being chased off the land with the nitrogen scourge, where they have often lived and worked for many generations, while nitrogen emissions have been reduced by 60%. The fact that this hardworking sector is performing to score an agricultural export record for the sixth time in a row does not seem to interest. In 2021, the Netherlands sold 104 billion in agricultural products abroad. The Dutch economy earned an estimated 46 billion from this agricultural export. According to hocuspocu policy, they would produce too much nitrogen, so they would have to turn in their nitrogen so that others could produce that nitrogen again. Are you still following, Mr. Chairman? Farmers have to make way for housing, among other things. Of course everyone wants a house, but as long as the borders are wide open, it's fighting the beers. Why should the successful agricultural sector give way to tens of thousands of lucky seekers from Verweggistan, whose vast majority does not make an economic contribution and who cost the Dutch taxpayer more than 16 billion a year? The cost of a quarter century migration is estimated at 400 billion. This is about equal to almost 60 years of Groningen gas extraction, the yield of which has actually been flushed down the well. As a result: 10,000 Groningers are bivaging in a wild house and the society is suffering from multi-culter terror. Mr. Chairman. With Rutte we drive from crisis to crisis. The housing crisis, the nitrogen crisis, the migration crisis and the climate crisis are draining the citizens' wallet. While no less than 60 billion goes to blurry investment funds for self-created climate and nitrogen problems, there is no money for burden relief. Worse still, purchasing power falls for everyone through the ice. The Nibud calculated an average income drop of €40 per month, based on an inflation rate of 3%, which is far too low. This government, which itself is the biggest driver of inflation, continues mercilessly to push up the energy bill. The end of the large green graws is not yet in sight. So far, the SDE+ has cost the modal family €1,250, but there is still a maximum of €5,400 in future commitments ahead. On top of this there is an SDE++ tax in the planning of about €630 per year per household. On top of that, the annual network costs per household increase from €440 to €600. Too much is being grabbed so much that 680 million has been transferred from the SDE pot to the general funds to finance the state-wide problem in the corona crisis. In the meantime, more than half a million households live in energy poverty. The thumb screws are turned even further. Rising energy costs go hand in hand with rising production costs, which continue to work in the price development of all goods and services. Combined with Ruttes Brussels friends' running money presses, the purchasing power runs even further. This, while the coalition agreement reads, I quote: 'In addition, we are reducing the burden of 3 billion, especially for low and middle incomes, workers and families. In doing so, we aim to ensure a balanced and on average positive purchasing power for all over the cabinet period."" Is this merely an attempt or is something really going to happen about this screaming inflation, driven by this cabinet? I'd like a response from the Prime Minister. Mr. Chairman. Increasing energy costs is mainly an attack on the weak. The printing of euros is mainly an attack on savers and pensioners. In short, everyone is heavily screwed and especially the elderly, who are unable to move. They are only beginning to become the real scapegoat, because after their working lives they are ageing. For years, their pensions have not been indexed. They're getting blamed for a housing shortage. But they had to stay home as long as they could. And that's why all those old people's homes had to be closed down, right? And now they would stay in too big a house for too long, often fully relieved, so that they could lower and bear future burdens. If they want to move, there is no affordable smaller house available. Don't be surprised if the power box 3 will be used in the fight to drive the elderly out of the house. With the mass immigration, which drives house prices even further, this is going to end in a tragedy. This cabinet seems to be over all shame by also decoupling the AOW as the sole benefit from the minimum wage. What a deception of the VVD, which went into the elections with the statement that the AOW would do more with the minimum wage. This affects not only the AOWs but also the compulsory pension contribution for all workers. So it's double checkout for this cabinet and his comrades. Because pension funds can force the financing of the energy transition, a sector that only costs money and barely makes any money. While Shell, known for his wealthy dividend at the ABP, was thrown out. Perhaps a welcome gift for the new ABP board member Paul Rosenmöller. The request to this cabinet is not to separate the AOW from the minimum wage. In view of the previous persistence of the cabinet on this point, I shall therefore table the next motion on behalf of my group. The: Mr Faber-van de Klashorst, Mr Van Strien, Mr Ton van Kesteren, Mr Van Hattem and Mr Bezaan proposed the following motion: [[Motion]] [[The Chamber,]] [[heard the debate,]] [[calls on the Government not to decouple the AOW benefit from the minimum wage, so that the increase in the minimum wage also increases the AOW benefit to an equal extent,]] [[and goes to the order of the day.]] [[She's getting No. kst-35788-D]]",True,0.113,0.777,0.111,-0.9344,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-15-eerstekamer-7,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 17, Session 7 (2022-02-15)",2022-02-15,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 7,Meeting 17,Sitting 2022-02-15,-,COVID,English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,PVV,Partij voor de Vrijheid,Opposition,Right to far-right,MarjoleinFaber-vandeKlashorst,"Faber-van de Klashorst, Marjolein",F,1960,62.0,True,2
64,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-15-eerstekamer-7.u29,"Mr President, thank you. Nineteen years and six cabinets were Tiny Kox chairman of my group in this Chamber. In the meantime, he has been elected President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Europe's oldest and largest treaty organisation, aimed at promoting the rule of law, human rights and democracy. That is a great honour, but it is also a great task, especially now that tensions on our continent are dangerously high. This also requires his attention. That is why our group has asked me as a new chairman. I thank the group for its confidence. I'm happy to do that, although I'm honest with you, I won't do that for nineteen years. Mr. Chairman. It is appropriate to congratulate a new cabinet, and that is what I am doing, including the Prime Minister. However, I do do so with an honest remark, because we, as SP, and that will not be a surprise, do not think it appropriate that a ruler who resigned a year ago as the first person responsible for the unprecedented injustice done to tens of thousands of countrymen should now return to his position as head of government. But we're not talking about that, so I'm not going to talk about it today either. Mr. Chairman. Colijn, Drees and Balkenende all had a fourth cabinet and now the prime minister joins. That's politically handsome. But a small shot in front of the bow: none of those previous fourth cabinets made it to the finish line. Anyway, it's good to talk to the Prime Minister here in the First Chamber today. He's not a guest that often, and in my opinion, it's always better to talk to someone than to talk to someone. This also immediately affects the introduction of the coalition agreement. This speaks of another political culture, in which differences are bridged. We think that is a good plan and we are also happy to participate. But my group is not looking for a pat on the back of the cabinet to be called 'constructive'. After all, we are always constructive and focused on stopping evil and, where possible, on establishing good. And what's good can go through and what's bad can go away. I cannot say it more simply for my group. We do not want to make the Netherlands even crooked and more liberal, but fairer and more social. So we work together where we can to achieve that. In my group's view, this coalition agreement is a crisis and recovery agreement. Rutte IV must try to repair what was broken under the Rutte I, II and III Cabinets, such as access to law, lack of maintenance of nature, which led to a crippling nitrogen crisis, and the acute shortage of affordable rental houses. On that last point, the cabinet might want to think about an extended rent stop now that we see that the rents are already rising sharply. That would be a false start for the Minister for Housing. Mr. Chairman. It also concerns the social imbalance in incomes and, above all, wealth. The new government is not doing anything about this extreme power inequality in the Netherlands, despite the fact that inflation is killing everyone. It has been promised in the coalition's electoral programmes, but it has not been done. On the contrary, and this is when today you don't have to be left at all to see that this distortion between the possessing class and the rest is really social, economic and political disruptive. Even the President of De Nederlandsche Bank, who was just referred to, said in Buitenhof that we are overtaxing labour in the Netherlands and that we are under-taxing wealth in the Netherlands. Does the Prime Minister really want to go into history as the one who hasn't done anything about this growing social problem all this time? Mr. Chairman. So there's a lot to fix now. The Prime Minister is showing ambition. But much ambition is worth little without clear work plans and delivery dates. Mr Rosenmöller mentioned this as well. Does the Prime Minister agree? Many ambitions in the coalition agreement appeal to us, but the big question for us is how many of these words will be translated into action until the elections in 2025. That's how fast they are again. For us, what you can and do counts, not what you want. I would therefore like to ask the Prime Minister for a clear check-off list for the next three years: to begin with, this is the plan, that is how we are going to do it, that is when it happens and then it is done. Mr. Chairman. I ask this because the coalition agreement can roughly be divided into three quarters and a quarter. That makes me fear for three years of dinner dancer, participation tables, strength sessions, scrum walls and everything that comes with it and makes me very nervous, I say from my own experience. On the other hand, I am delighted by the decisive implementation of concrete plans. That is why I am asking for such a specific check-out list. The coalition agreement contains good and bad plans, but above all many ambitions. I told you. Again and again, the questions are: when and how? But in reading it appears that quite a few ambitions are contradictory in substance. They ask for choices, but they're not made. Short sentences sometimes also conceal major system changes and huge challenges. The Achilles heel of a lot of government thinking is the execution. I'm not saying anything new. That's what the government shows itself at times and again just really bad at. That's dangerous. Ambitions that are not realised lead to diminished confidence and even mistrust. The CDA was talking about it, and I heard the Christian Union talking about it too. In the meantime, it is essential to restore confidence, and this is promised. I have two examples. ""We have the ambition to abolish the surcharges."" What are people doing with such an expression and what good is it for them? ""We also have the ambition to simplify the tax system."" What does that say? What's that gonna do? Does the Prime Minister see the danger of untruthful ambitions? If so, what will he do about it? Mr. Chairman. For their parents, generous compensation and emotional healing is crucial to their justice, says the coalition agreement. I very much agree with that, but for this generous compensation and emotional healing, the budget should not be leading. The unprecedented injustice that parents and children have suffered must be leading. Is that how the Prime Minister sees it? The content determines and not the budget. Money that is needed must come. By this, I do not mean open-ended funding for all those consultants and consultancy firms who have put themselves on top of it, where a lot of money is flowing, but a generous and quick concession for those who have been waiting for far too long in misery and uncertainty. That's still happening. Mr. Chairman. The same goes for the Groningers. What do they buy for ""a quick perspective,"" as stated in the coalition agreement? They want a concrete date when their problems are resolved. The degrading rows that were outside in Groningen are engraved on our retina: a disgrace to the government; a disgrace to this country. This failed implementation, not only of that arrangement, is not only detrimental to confidence in the cabinet, but also detrimental to confidence in the whole of politics. How will the Prime Minister restore the confidence of the Groningen people? Mr. Chairman. It's time for a compliment. I'm about halfway there, so I should be able to do that now. Abolishing the landlord's tax is a good plan. I would like to say that we have argued in favour of this since its introduction in 2013. That is why I would also like to take action now, because too much damage has been done to the housing market. Abolish the lending system: it's totally fine, exactly what we want. It should never have been introduced. But action for the students who have been or are going to be the victims of this debt system will be the coming period. It also means, for us, that we do not allow a large group of students to pay the bill for this political and social miscarriage for decades to come. The same applies to those students who have not been in debt to DUO, but who have indeed borrowed privately, knocked on their door at parents or others, took additional jobs and have therefore been delayed in their studies. We also have to take that group with us. For us, their trust must also be cleared up and clean up. Is the Prime Minister gonna do this? Mr. Chairman. If the cabinet really wants to regain confidence, then the decoupling of the AOW and the austerity of care are totally counterproductive. We think that's bad plans, I'll tell the Prime Minister. Do what you want with it. These signals are also widely shared by other parties today. I'm not after any motions or anything like that, but I'd like to give you that signal. If a motion is needed for that, I am happy to endorse it. Mr. Chairman. Let me highlight one example of the cuts in care that has touched me particularly, namely the cuts in care for the elderly. This means that in the future caregivers will have to take care of more people. The standard of the number of people you have to take care of is raised, but that runs counter to practice. Then you're wondering, which desk did this come up with? Older people are getting an indication later and later, the problem is getting worse, the length of stay is getting shorter and carers are already talking about ""a portal to hospice."" The workload is getting much higher and they need more and no fewer colleagues to give our older people a decent old age, and the attention and care they deserve. Or do I see something wrong here, I ask the Prime Minister. One more example: youth care. Youth care must be organised in such a way that young people who need help receive exactly the care they need at the right time. However, the cuts that were accompanied by the transition from youth care to the municipalities in 2015 have had a significant negative impact on the care of young people. That concern has been stuck for a long time. The young people are the victims and are damaged. That is a disaster we must stop each other now. What is the Prime Minister going to do, also financially, to give back to young people with big problems the confidence that there is a government that protects them when needed? Mr. Chairman. The point of climate. For the climate, huge funds are set up with the aim of encouraging companies to reduce emissions through subsidies. But why direct subsidies? Why isn't there a price? Has the trail of tightening permits been explored? I know from experience that this can be very effective in tackling unwanted emissions. Why should you subsidise what can be imposed or priced through permits? Does the Prime Minister agree with me that companies are primarily responsible and that it is not the intention to subsidise what can be required by a permit or what can be priced? Mr. Chairman. The national disgrace of children growing up in poverty in one of the richest countries in the world must be wiped out. This Chamber has spoken out on this and the previous government has promised us our strength. This cabinet wants to halve the number of children growing up in poverty in four years. Based on a clear, realistic, relative definition of poverty. Whatever that may be, I hope that child poverty will not be defined. And why does that take so long? We know the names and postal codes of those kids and their parents. We also know the most effective measures. The previous cabinet had deep pockets to limit economic damage. My group also wants to see measures from these same deep pockets which will put an end to child poverty, not just in four years' time, because four years in a child's life is an eternity. Mr. Chairman. The same shame of poverty also applies to the Caribbean part of the Netherlands. The Netherlands is not an island. Our continent Europe is full of dangerous tensions, just now that we are following it all, international diplomacy must work. Talking is so much better than shooting. The Netherlands, as a hub of international law, must now show its value. Mobilise our diplomats and not our military, my group says. Mr President, another positive note, almost at the end of my speech. We are pleased that the government understands that an amendment to the Treaty on European Union is necessary to counter erosion of shared values. We welcome the commitment of the Foreign Minister, last week in this Chamber, to put this need into practice in a European context. Mr President, concluding. The lack of maintenance in our society is regrettable and the need is high. A need which, by the way, could not be read out from the length of this formation. On the other hand, public confidence in government and politics is historically low. What is needed now is action and implementation. In his first declaration of government twelve years ago, this Prime Minister, Mr Thorbecke, quoted: ""wait for our actions."" But where Thorbecke subsequently radically reformed and improved the Dutch state system, in the opinion of my group under three Rutte Cabinets was not built up, but mainly demolished. This Rutte IV cabinet now seems to recognise with this crisis and recovery agreement that it is necessary to repair what has been broken down in the past ten years. That challenge is now on the table, I say to the Prime Minister. We read his words in the coalition agreement. We are now waiting for his actions.

There are a number of proposals within the framework of left-wing cooperation, for example, to set a cap or ceiling at the level of donations. It's called a lot of things. Do not ask me to mention an amount, because I do not know that as a spokesperson at the moment. Sometimes people think about business. But Mrs Leijten's point, about no transparency, is simply total monkey. Mr. Chairman. A long time ago, state law professor Jan Vis, also known as Senator of D66, referred to political parties as ""old elephants who are struggling to find a last place to die."" According to the late Pim Fortuyn, God rest his soul, the political party has become ""a selection machine and framework organisation for the delivery of elected representatives of political and administrative offices."" Policologist Filip of Prague, I've had lessons from him, and he calls parties an appendage to the state apparatus. C. de Vries, a D66 scientist, said we're dying. F. Becker, PvdA scientist, describes parties as brain death. Add to that the ideological mergers that parties have undergone. From the VVD to GroenLinks, they all actually share the same opinion on crucial issues such as climate socialism, the EU and the diversity noise. All these clubs in America would all fall within the left wing of a democratic party. Their differences are no longer perceptible to the naked eye. Why do they still exist? Well, because of the grant. The Minister bases himself on the report of the Veling Committee. It calls political parties ""the primary intermediary between population and politics."" The chairman, Mr Kars Veling, was previously the leader of such a party, namely the Christian Union. He has given it a lot of thought and has come to the conclusion that members' parties are really indispensable. Well, surprisingly. That is what the Jetten motion is getting over. Then there's 9 million more going to those old elephants. Their lives are being extended; they are kept alive artificially. But what's the big deal? Minister Kaag is Minister of Finance. He throws money everywhere, so why not here? The fact that Henk and Ingrid can't afford the groceries is a lot less interesting. The question is: if all these member parties are so proud of their member democracy, why do they all do their best to reduce their members' control? That's been going on for decades. Bart Tromp, who used to write nice pieces in Het Parool on Wednesdays, was allowed to complain for years about how Felix Rottenberg kept the participation of the members to a minimum. Tromp found that Rottenberg transformed the PvdA into ""the temporary agency for MPs and an advertising agency for the Kok list."" The members' parties are so democratic that, for example, members can find out from the newspaper who is the new leader of the political group. Then there is an applause machine in the form of a meeting as a congress. Actually, there's no more member involved. My group leader would like to tell you how, as a starting member of the VVD Chamber, he made a round along the so-called party barons. It was advisable for the further development of the political career to polish some shoes there. He was happy to do that. These party barons were the viceroys of the VVD. They controlled and controlled the famous Chambers. But Henry Emperor set it on fire. Today the VVD has a VVD festival. Then you can take a picture with Sophie Hermans.Nice. and you can network nicely. I watched a Saturday morning with great pleasure on television, a meeting of GroenLinks. It was something very fundamental: a close cooperation with the Labour Party, perhaps a merger. The chairman appeared on stage to explain that it was a GroenLinks conversation. The party councils were abolished, so we learned. We saw Mr. Klaver on stage. In a career around him were the people who were allowed to talk. The Jessiah functioned as a kind of presenter and in turn gave people the floor. Funny, everyone who sat there agreed with him. And everyone who spoke agreed with him. The people were clearly all pre-programmed. There was no vote either. This is what we call the famous'member democracy'. So let's stop funding those member parties. We don't need another penny for those dying elephants. If citizens unite, they can do it themselves. And absolutely no to the exorbitant money bounce, the subsidies mite, which we are now going to organise again. Mr. Chairman. What parties need in practice, above all, is protection. Recently there was an attack of uniformed Antifa harness in black leather jackets, black trousers and black hoodies in the middle of Amsterdam, where GroenLinks rules, the city of Femke Halsema. The police escorted this left-wing scum right to the party office of Forum for Democracy. A whole detour was made, a big walk. On the spot, paint bombs could be thrown to the party office. The police stood there and watched it. Afterwards the procession happily continued under police supervision. This is how they deal with people who think differently in Amsterdam. What does the Minister think of that? A political party is simply attacked under police supervision. Mr. Chairman. This law, let's be clear, is intended to attack the PVV, for years the biggest challenger of the left-liberal consensus. In the past, my party has received a little support from the United States. You know, that country that sacrificed so much for our liberation. With Margraten there are a lot of boys who made the highest sacrifice for that. It's our main military ally. When there are elections, everyone in the Netherlands becomes an American know-it-all. That's how we're intertwined with this country. No more money from this country. Money may come from corrupt countries such as Malta or Romania. My question to the Minister is: explain. For those parties who want to hang on to the subsidy infusion, there must of course be strong, strict rules. It's bizarre that D66 receives just as much as 1 million euros. It was the game changer of the election. The results were just bought. This was reinforced by the dominance of D66 on NPO66. Every evening Mrs Kaag is on the grieving tube and then the North Korean Kaagdocumentary: yes, our democracy is going well! That million came from an Internet billionaire who got rich thanks to Facebook. The animal party also shared in the Postcodekanjer. Another billionaire is a great donor of D66 Amsterdam. He then acquired a crucial real estate position on the Zuidas in Amsterdam for a reasonable price, where possible the most expensive place in Amsterdam. After his donation, the D66 alderman suddenly saw the importance of this: cash register, bingo, D66. And we see the CDA's business club, where the millions are flying around your ears. Apparently, people still want to put money in the splinter party. On March 10, 2021, we read in De Telegraaf: ""DENK advertises against enemies of Islam on a Turkish website."" We also see how Soros has bought into Dutch politics and now has his own party, Volt. So I'd say yes, take the big money. Those who receive subsidies may be restricted. Those who do not accept taxpayers' money must be given as much freedom as possible. No money from unfree countries, of course. And yes, put a cap on it. And yes, leave it up to what's the $4.500 but free. Mr. Chairman. In the year 2021, the JOVD, the youth department of the VVD, wrote the following; this is my last, final paragraph. I quote: ""Geert Wilders proves that he does not need a classic party and government subsidies to get it far. In addition, there are other ways to let individuals move to a seat in our parliament, the Provincial States or the city council. If the gap between the citizen and politics can be closed somewhere, it is in the wallet. A citizen does not donate unless he feels involved and related to the politics and the political party in question. A political party likes to run a little faster if the survival of the party depends on it."" That was the reason for this youth club of the VVD to say: no more subsidies to political parties. I couldn't agree more.

I was allowed to return to the heart of democracy as a member of the House of Representatives in order to return to my ideals of striving for justice and justice. I was also allowed to return as a mother of two daughters. You understand I'm a grateful man. Returning to the heart of democracy also gives me the privilege of getting back to work on the craftsmanship that MPs are allowed to do. From the first day I was here again, I am working on my task in the Committee of Inquiry into Natural Gas Extraction in Groningen. We're in the middle of a very intensive phase of preconcussions in private. That is why I haven't seen so many debate rooms in this new Chamber inside. I hope to be able to pick it all up soon, and that's why I came in your midst a little later tonight. Nevertheless, I would also very much like to work on our task as co-legislator tonight with regard to a law on the financing of political parties and their transparency. Mr. Chairman. Political parties are not only citizens' organisations, but also have a public function. ""The public interest of political parties"" was also called the report written by the Veling Committee on the evaluation of this law. Political parties are part of a system that we attach importance to, a system of transparency and fair elections, which are not about money but about everyone's equal input. Because of the influence that political parties have on our country's governance, it is no comfort or luxury to know where the money they can do their job comes from. It is even an absolute necessity to know that, nationally but also locally. Mr. Chairman. The law before us tonight is the result of the review of the Finance Act, political parties. The law strengthens the rules for funding political parties by increasing transparency about gifts, the limitation of gifts from outside the European Union, and raising the funds for political parties in line with the motion adopted by the Chamber in 2019. Now there is also a path to come up with the Law on Political Parties. Some things surprise you sometimes when you haven't been around for quite some time. You're wondering what it would be like with certain laws, in this case the Wpp. He's not here yet. I still think it is a good idea, and the Christian Union thinks it is a good idea, that we should now deal with this law, namely the adaptation of the Financing Act, political parties, which was on the agenda in the run-up to the Wpp. I agree with the questions that many colleagues have already asked. I heard that one. What's the status of this law? I am assuming that the Minister will be able to answer that question. Mr. Chairman. I'm going into a number of parts of this law. I shall begin with an issue that has not now been included in the legislative proposal and on which, together with Mrs Arib, I have drafted and tabled an amendment. It concerns the identification of some of the additional resources included in the legislative proposal for political parties for the political and scientific institutes and the political youth organisations. There is a risk of not including it in this law. Because without an ear tag, our scientific institutes must compete with a campaign plan or membership recruitment for their money. There is a great chance that the short-term interest of a campaign will then prevail over the long-term interest of ideological thought formation. 'Cause what's the big deal? For me, that is in looking beyond the delusion of the day and producing new ideas, in keeping the ideological compass on which a party has founded itself and in reviewing ideas, offering internal counterpower, if you will, and also against the pursuit of decision-making that we may sometimes fall prey to in the Chamber. I see that in my own party, too, where the Greens of the Prinster Foundation played an essential role in reviewing our programme of principles, which is the basis for our electoral programme and our political action in this Chamber, but also in all the other representative bodies in which Christian Union representatives were elected. There can be no campaign against that interest. That is why my group has tabled an amendment to the effect that, in line with the Veling Committee, those additional resources for political parties should also, to a proportionate extent, be granted to the scientific institutes according to the existing system of distribution, in order, as the treasurers of the parties recently said in De Groene Amsterdammer, 'to protect themselves from ourselves'. The amendment also refers to the second group I mentioned, which is crucial for us in the political system, namely youth organisations. With a modest budget, they can achieve a great deal. They act as a louse in the fur of their mother parties and also function from the young generations as a counterpower within a party. Not to mention the opportunities they offer young people to develop politically-ideologically. We therefore also follow the advice of the Veling Committee to prevent these youth organisations from competing with other party interests for much-needed funding. Mr. Chairman. I, too, would like to return to the local parties. I have drawn attention to this earlier, and I am also pleased that they are currently playing a major role in the contributions I have heard from several colleagues here. For they have been a permanent place in our local democracy for a long time. They are parties that are not always represented in the Chamber, but may be represented. In a few weeks' time, they can become the biggest in the municipal elections. Mr. Chairman. We see a vulnerability in this. That is not a fictitious situation I imagine. We've just seen that in the past few years. Here in The Hague, too, it has been the subject of research for years: integrity research on the financing of a local party. But this also plays in other municipalities. This is detrimental, including to politics as a whole and to its prestige. But there's a story behind it. On the one hand, we see that there is too little visibility and insight into the financial flows of local parties and that they do not have to justify their finances, as national parties have to. On the other hand, we also see that they cannot claim the national subsidy and are sometimes dependent on more unorthodox forms of party financing, which I think we can rightly question. The Veling Committee, which carried out the investigation into the evaluation of the law, also saw that interaction and recommended: bring them under the operation of this law and come up with a grant provision. Mrs Leijten has tabled an amendment on this subject, and my group is looking at it with great interest. This is one of the subjects that has arisen with the passing of time since the Veling report. This is a discussion that has been pushed forward since the start of working on this law. But it is important to make room for this in our legal framework as well. Mr. Chairman. Then there is the subject that has dominated the media enormously: the maximisation of gifts. In doing so, my group takes into account the interests that the Veling Committee has distinguished, namely the autonomous position of political parties, the risk of undue influence and the principle of equal opportunities. The Veling Committee did not think the time was right in 2018 to give an opinion on this and to make a specific recommendation on this maximation. But the committee did not rule that out either, because the donations to political parties could increase substantially in the near future. We've seen that happen. So there is also reason for the Christian Union to think about maximizing gifts. I would very much like to know how the Minister is looking at that right now. Mr. Chairman. I would also very much like to put the following thought down. I have not yet prepared an amendment to that effect. I like this legal treatment that really gives room for open debate and thought-forming. These aren't topics where you make a choice in one night of ice cream, I guess. So it's also good that we can take some time for this legal treatment. We would also like to know how the Minister is looking at the idea of setting a maximum amount for the total amount of donations that parties could receive. That is actually in the light of the level playing field. Couldn't you do better with that? After all, the best ideas must win elections, not the best fundraising actions. This also played a role in the media. I saw Professor Gerrit Voerman put forward a proposal for this. So I would also very much like to hear from the Minister how she looks at that. Do we perhaps need to investigate this further first, so that we know what the pros and cons of such a choice might be or how it should take shape? I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on this. Mr. Chairman. Then there is the transparency of donations. It's important. GRECO has been calling attention to this for a long time. My group also believes that we should look further at this. I also see a number of proposals from colleagues on this subject, which go even further than the proposal that the Minister has given a place in the legislative proposal. My group also considers it very important for a democracy at this time that the revenue of the parties is as transparent as possible. You should be as open about that as possible. The same applies to gifts that can come from abroad. The Veling Committee made a very clear choice: simply no longer allow gifts from abroad. We can imagine a great deal of that. We see that the bill offers more room. The concern was, of course, that we do not want any improper influence on foreign actors. I remember that we talked a lot about this in the previous Chamber. I would very much like to know from the Minister whether under the current legislative proposal it is now unthinkable that Russian money would be donated to a Dutch political party via a legal person in Hungary. Let me give you an example that, I think, is not fictitious. I would very much like to know whether such situations are excluded under this bill. If that is not the case, what amendments have been tabled now, should we support them in order to prevent that? We would find that a very undesirable situation. The original bill was there much earlier in a perhaps a little bit different time than it is now. I believe that the current context should be taken into account. So I would very much like to have a look at that from the Minister. Mr. Chairman. Then there's a more hypothetical question, but there's one that pops up. We also know that the call for transparency can prevent people from making a donation to a political party. Perhaps it is conceivable that this could lead to a reduction in the revenues of political parties. In this light, I ask how the Minister looks at this, knowing that additional resources have now been provided for the political parties. Up to 2024 that is, by my mind, a sum of EUR 9 million, but after 2024 that is a lower amount. Is it possible in that light that you would continue that? I put it very deliberately as a question because I would like to hear the Minister's response. Maybe I'm thinking too gloomy, but maybe there's a real concern in it too. Mr. Chairman. I conclude by wishing this minister, whom I am experiencing for the first time in the debate, a great deal of blessing and wisdom in the task she is allowed to perform, in the mother department, in the heart of public administration. I look forward to working together, including with all my colleagues here.

67,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-16-tweedekamer-3.u77,"Mr. Chairman. From this point on, first of all, I would like to say nothing about the qualifications of the replacement chairman. I am also speaking on behalf of Mrs Chicken of the PvdA. In 2018 the VVD campaigned with the metaphor over a vase. That vase would symbolize the Netherlands. Breakable, but proudly standing, by being held by millions of Dutch. And as long as we were all holding that little vase, we were still a cool country. But it's not just up to the locals to keep that vase whole. It's also up to politics. This morning, the research report of the Research Council on Security was presented. Although I have not yet been able to study the more than 300 pages, I dare say that this report causes cracks in that proverbial vase. That has nothing to do with the fact that mistakes have been made, because in every crisis, of course, we make mistakes. It has to do with the fact that I fear that many mistakes have been made in the past two years that have never been recognised and have never been corrected, which means that they do not learn from them. GroenLinks has been concerned for some time in this corona crisis that politics is not sufficiently remote from our institutions. How we organized the decision-making process is at odds with how we organised our democratic rule of law. Advisors need to advise, ministries make policies and ultimately it's up to politics to make the choices. Nowhere does this intertwinedness come back as harrowingly as in the Hoods Directive in the care of the elderly. Research carried out by Nieuwsuur.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... This is about something, because we know that the corona virus caused many deaths in the nursing homes. At the same time, in the debate on 1 December, the Prime Minister spoke to me and others that the OMT opinion would be fully autonomous and independent. I can only draw one conclusion, namely that this has not always been true. The OVV has been able to view all the pieces, without black-painted pages, and concludes: ""Comments were clarifications, but sometimes it was really about content."" It is not that the Chamber at the time was not critical of this mask directive. The Chamber has indeed done its job and has repeatedly called upon the cabinet to do so in debates. That is why I have the following question. Can the Minister share all the suggestions made in relation to the OMT opinions over the last two years? Does the Minister disagree with what has happened in his ministry? Does the Minister agree with me that we should better protect institutions from political interference? Mr. Chairman. Not only OMT opinions should be completely independent. The same goes for RIVM. At the same time, RIVM is not an independent administrative body, but an agency of the Minister of VWS. The RIVM director conducts an annual meeting with the Ministry. I wonder whether the Minister thinks that it is in the interests of our institutions that we should look at this again? Mr. Chairman. As a parliament, we have to make continuous assessments. Think of the balance between constitutional rights to be free and to be able to move freely, and the duty of the government to promote public health and ensure that the corona virus does as little damage as possible. This consideration is a continuous struggle between rights and obligations. I am glad that we can overcome many restrictions in the coming period either because so many people have been vaccinated or boosterd, or because they have been cured. This is also because people adhere to the basic measures and are being tested. This is because the people in care fought for our vulnerable and, of course, because the omikron variant is less sickening. I'm glad many restrictions can be removed. At the same time, I can imagine that people with vulnerable health were watching the press conference with lead in their shoes. GroenLinks and PvdA believe that the government can and should do more to protect vulnerable people. In my view, this is not the case, because we ask the cabinet to move after a motion to ensure that FFP2 covers and self-tests can be made available free of charge. But that's not gonna happen. OMT advice after OMT advice calls for attention to be paid to the high costs that people incur. My question to the cabinet is simple: when do we make self-tests and FFP2 covers available free of charge, as other countries do? I also wonder whether some measures are not being relaxed too quickly. For example, wearing masks is not a serious violation of our privacy, but falls into most places. Why does the cabinet choose to do that? Because it can help protect vulnerable people. The homework advice is also being amended. For many people that is a great relief, but not for vulnerable people. That is why I would also like to ask this Minister if he is prepared to embrace the initiative law of D66 and GroenLinks, which asks for the right to work at home. Mr. Chairman. Long covid is still not taken seriously, while thousands of people are sick at home. I would like to ask the cabinet why no compensation fund is set up in the short term. Finally, Mr President. Already a year and a half ago GroenLinks said that preventive testing can make more possible and maybe even prevent lockdowns. In this respect, I am glad that that message has finally landed; better late than never. But to be quite honest, 1G is a bit out of the blue in this package of measures. Why is 1G specifically used for events with more than 500 visitors and not more than 400 or 600? Will there be more test locations at the venue of the event itself? Does the Ministry ensure that all test sites are reachable at low threshold? Can the Cabinet guarantee that this measure will be reviewed on 15 March? I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. I have one final point to make, because in some of the interruptions I hear colleagues saying contradictory things. You cannot say on the one hand that the cabinet is responsible for so many people being infected by covid, and on the other hand have been calling as a party for months that all measures must be taken off. I would like to say at this point that politics is sometimes also making very difficult choices.",True,0.069,0.801,0.13,0.9975,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-16-tweedekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 51, Session 3 (2022-02-16)",2022-02-16,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 51,Sitting 2022-02-16,-,COVID,English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,GL,GroenLinks,Opposition,Centre-left to left,LisaWesterveld,"Westerveld, Lisa",F,1981,41.0,True,2

On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would also like to extend a warm welcome to both leaders. I wish you a great deal of joy in your office, in your wisdom, and I say this with great emphasis on this point. Mr. Chairman. Then to the bill. A landing plane and a call a little later with the announcement ""We got him."" Two moments I'll never forget. Not long ago, a very serious criminal offence had been committed in the vicinity of The Hague, which was investigated by a detective team and by me as a district attorney. Literally day and night work was done on the matter; it was so serious. Soon the suspect appeared to have taken the neighborhood abroad, but at some point we got information that he would, perhaps temporarily, return. One Sunday night it was time. At a police station, we tracked over the Internet the flight where our suspect was on board. Shortly after the landing, the Marechaussee called me with the redeeming announcement: ""We have him."" The arrest was a fact. Mr. Chairman. It may be naive for me, a little silly perhaps, but at no time have I considered that it would be better for the safety of citizens in this country if that suspect had stayed abroad and if he had been prevented from boarding that plane. Frankly, I did not detect such a reaction from the government when some time ago two prime suspects in the Marengo trial were arrested in distant foreign countries and were eventually transferred to the Netherlands. Speaking of national security! The absurd feeling of which the previous one is an illustration is still not getting my group down in terms of the legislative proposal we are discussing. The fight against terrorism can count on generous support from our side, but we still have big questions about this bill. I would like to highlight some of the main points. The starting point for my group is that Dutch people who participate in a terrorist organisation should be arrested, brought to the Netherlands and tried if necessary. In response to written questions from this Chamber, the Secretary of State also expresses his strong commitment to trial and to the prevention of impunity and to trial, preferably in the region. But two lines later he acknowledges: ""There are currently no options to bring ISIS fighters to justice internationally or in the region."" Well, then, isn't impunity the only possible consequence of putting the national front door on the night lock? A little against my better judgment in asking the cabinet, on behalf of my group, whether national security and the rule of law would no longer benefit much from the detection, prosecution, trial, execution of an imposed sentence and then, if necessary, the withdrawal of Dutch citizenship under Article 14 (2) (b) of the Rijkswet and junk declaration. Mr. Chairman. Article 7 of the European Convention on Nationality mentions some situations in which States are exceptionally allowed to withdraw a person's nationality. The volunteering for foreign military service is such a situation. Our state law adds that it must be a state involved in combat against the Kingdom or an alliance of which the Kingdom is a member. Another exception is behaviour which seriously harms the essential interests of the State. Given the far-reaching consequences of the withdrawal of nationality, this calls for an intrusive, as far as we are concerned, pre-trial judicial review and the application of clear and high thresholds. In the light of the Treaty, what is the government's view of the proportionality and subsidiarity of this bill? I would ask the cabinet to be more specific in its response than in the much repeated reply so far that withdrawal takes place only if it is necessary in the individual case, in the interests of national security. As far as legal protection is concerned, too, my group still has reservations. In a professional case that we led the cabinet as an example, the judge could not see the underlying documents of the AIVD, because the lawyer did not think he was allowed to do so. The judge then held that this remained at the plaintiff's risk and stated that ""the court should, on the basis of the foregoing, assume the accuracy of the notice'. I ask the directors: how does that relate to the cabinet's statement that 'any decision to withdraw, without exception, is fully and without reservation reviewed by the administrative judge'? Isn't a verdict like this in stark contrast to the legal protection enjoyed by a person as a suspect in a criminal case? Mr. Chairman. My final question concerns the advice given by the Public Prosecutor's Office prior to the withdrawal of Dutch citizenship. Under no circumstances has the public prosecutor's opinion on a proposed revocation decision been followed so far. Our question to the Secretary of State to give a very specific explanation of what this was about, so under what circumstances these opinions would have been or will be followed, has not yet been answered in substance. I am putting this question on the table again. With unabated interest, my group looks forward to the answer.

70,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-22-tweedekamer-16.u13,"Mr Ellian has asked how I look at this bill. I think it is a good legislative proposal, because it represents a first step in a number of very firm and excellent recommendations from the Veling Committee. At the same time, I have also emphasised in my main letter that this is not the end point and that this law on political parties is going to come about. Mrs Arib, Mr Bishop and Mrs Van der Plas also asked about the relationship between this evaluation law and the Law on Political Parties. This is a first important step in the implementation of the Law on Political Parties. We are dealing with a number of things that we need to do anyway, but I would like to deal with this law on political parties in the coming period, because we also need it to strengthen the independent position of the political parties by clarifying a number of things. My planning, because that's what was asked for ""where is it?', The specific question that several Members had is that I want to consult the law in the second half of the year. What's about the alignment I have? Rules on the transparency of the internal organisation of political parties, including on digital political campaigns and microtargeting, the establishment of a separate independent supervisor, and also look at various aspects when it comes to banning political parties. Article 2:20 Civil Code must also have a further specification in this law. I shall come back to the position of the decentralised political parties in response to the questions raised by several Members. Then I'll get to block two. That's about maximation, prohibition and avoidance. Several Members of this Chamber have made the proposal to really see if we can work on the maximisation of donations to political parties. The Veling Committee was more than happy to point out that there was insufficient reason to maximize the donations of political parties, but at that time he did make a move. If the number of substantial donations from political parties were to increase, the introduction of a ceiling could be considered. You also see, and of course I have seen this as a minister, that some committee members have started to think differently about this too. I would first like to point out a number of arguments for and against maximation and give attention to them, before I also give a direction myself. An important argument in favour of maximisation is to prevent a political party becoming too dependent on one or a few large donors. That calls for the introduction of a maximum. A second point concerns the possibility of avoiding a ceiling. A number of Members of Parliament rightly drew attention to this last week. In order to minimise the risk of circumvention, it is advisable, as far as I am concerned, to exclude as few donors as possible from that ceiling, because you really have to ensure that all lines are clear and that we do not have to think of special U-turn constructions to do, maxim or not, do or do not do a gift. I say this because, if the Chamber decides to adopt this bill, you will have to make it clear from now on who the natural persons behind these legal entities are. So that argument is dealt with. A third point of attention is the height of the threshold of the ceiling. In this context, Mrs Dekker-Abdulaziz asked about the consequences of the amendment on item No. 35 of the SP, which sets the maximum at 100,000. Looking at the donations received by political parties in 2020, the number of donations above 100 000 is very limited and the impact of this threshold on the funding of most political parties would be relatively limited. At the same time, in 2021, the Chamber also mentioned a number of donations that were far above that. When it comes to maximisation, it is therefore a weighting whether you want to take a very big step or whether you want to follow the proposal of the SP, which is based on a ton, where you can also decide with each other as a Chamber to see what influence that has on the practice of political parties, to follow and evaluate whether or not that violates an autonomous position and whether or not that entails the risk of statification. So I don't have an armored view of the amount. I can see that this is a significant change in the interpretation of the law, because it has always been about transparency. So I can imagine that the Chamber takes into consideration that this is a different interpretation of the law than we have used so far. You can go in different directions in the maximation of the amount, but then these are my concerns.",True,0.046,0.812,0.142,0.997,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-22-tweedekamer-16,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 53, Session 16 (2022-02-22)",2022-02-22,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 16,Meeting 53,Sitting 2022-02-22,-,COVID,English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,HankeBruinsSlot,"Bruins Slot, Hanke",F,1977,45.0,True,2

76,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u2,"Madam President. Yesterday thousands and thousands of people gathered around the world with blue-yellow flags and texts against the war in Ukraine, also on Dam Square in Amsterdam and in many other Dutch cities. They were young and old, people of all political minds and from all over the world, including Ukrainian and Russian citizens, who said the same thing with one voice worldwide. We condemn the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine. We condemn this unprecedented act of aggression against a democratic European country. We condemn President Putin and his cabal. Our heart is with the people of Ukraine. Our hearts are with the innocent women, men and children who have to hide from enemy fire day and night. It's with the people who are now leaving everything behind to find a safe place to stay. It's with the brave citizens who unarmed managed to stop a Russian tank. It is with the Ukrainian military who have been defending their country with lion's pride for days. And it is, of course, with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who in person is the example of Ukraine's determination after the raid. His words in the center of Kiev, dressed in a green shard vest and surrounded by members of his cabinet, are impressive. We are all here, he said, and we defend our independence. Thus he stands before his troops and among his people, as a hero of his country. I've been in regular contact with President Zelensky for the last few days. It is an unreal and also moving thought that any conversation can be the last. After last Thursday, the unthinkable has become possible and impossible. This new reality forces us to stand, of us as politics and as a country, and of the whole free world. People are extremely concerned about what this means, of course for the people of Ukraine but also for our own security and our own way of life. I understand those concerns. That is why I would like to say the following on behalf of the cabinet today at the beginning of this debate. This is not a time for shakyness and restraint, but for determined and united action, both at national and international level. In the run-up to this war, President Putin has done everything possible to bring about international divisions. He's reaching the opposite. Europe, NATO and all the free and democratic countries of the world are one in their rejection of this attack, one in their support for the Ukrainian people, and one in their response. That is what we need now that security and stability in our part of the world are seriously threatened. We are dealing with an aggressor who crosses new borders every day, violates international law and does not even shy away from the nuclear threat. The most important task of any government, of any government, is to keep the country safe. Everyone wonders in these days: where does this end, where does Putin stop? No one can answer these questions today, but the fact is that the Netherlands is embedded in international structures that protect us, make us stronger and enable us to do exactly that: keep this country safe. Together with other countries of the European Union and with our allies in NATO, we have been able to take great steps in a short time. Russia has been largely isolated by an unprecedented sanction package. That is why the leaders of Russia and also the Russian war machine are being hit financially hard. European airspace is closed to Russian aircraft. The Netherlands and other countries help Ukraine with military equipment, including anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles. And the eastern border of the NATO territory is rapidly being strengthened, because we need to be prepared for everything. Our Dutch F-16 and F-35 pilots have taken immediate action over Poland. And the men and women of our armed forces in Lithuania also contribute to the deterrent. The Netherlands, together with allies, is ready to do more if necessary. The image changes per day and sometimes even per hour. One thing is certain: security is our most precious asset and the basis for our free and democratic society. We have to protect that, and we have to defend it with each other. Our armed forces must be ready, now and in the future, to face these new threats. We must also bear in mind that this war will not be without economic consequences, not for the global economy, not for Dutch entrepreneurs doing business in Ukraine and Russia, and not for all of us, as energy prices may increase even further. There are economic consequences, but if that is the price of security and freedom, we must be prepared to pay that price with each other. Of course, the cabinet will do everything possible to mitigate the economic consequences. We're not abandoning each other in this country. We must prepare ourselves for the fact that some of the Ukrainians who are now fleeing head-on, will come to our country, away from the violence, away from the Russian threat. I firmly believe that the Netherlands and the Dutch will show solidarity with these people. We saw it on Dam Square yesterday: it belongs to the Netherlands. As a cabinet, we will also work together in Europe on this issue in order to provide the best possible assistance to anyone fleeing the war zone. Any Ukrainian who is seeking a temporary safe passage must be helped generously. Madam President. None of us can predict what this war will mean in the long term, for Ukraine, for geopolitical relations, for cooperation in the European Union and NATO, for us as the Netherlands, and also for Russia and the Russian people themselves, of whom we must not forget that today much of this war does not want either. With the Russian raid in Ukraine, a page in the book of world history has turned. For us, peace, freedom and security were a gift for generations. That self-evidentness is no longer there today. We must stop Russian aggression, Putin's aggression, together with our partners and allies, united, determined, united. That's the only way.

Neither the Ukrainian people nor the Russian people have anything to do with this brother war. Nevertheless, BVNL wants the Netherlands to remain neutral. Was the Netherlands wrong when we remained neutral during the First World War? Of course not. Were we wrong in 1939, when we wanted to remain neutral again? No. That fits in with our history of 100 years of neutrality policy. And is it wrong to argue for neutrality now? No. We can remain neutral as long as there is no NATO country involved. The Hague also has a reputation in the field of international peace. That is why I ask the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to play a role in future peace negotiations on the basis of neutrality. Mr. Chairman. When I stood up for my officer's inspection the question was asked: are you willing to die for the Netherlands? I answered that question with a full yes. This is my criterion for supporting military activities. And that is why my question to the leaders present: are you willing to die for Ukraine? Mr. Chairman. Before we do anything, we must always identify the collateral damage, both when sending soldiers and weapons and when imposing sanctions. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and not a member of the EU. We have already voted in a referendum and the result was: no. BVNL is against sending soldiers, against sending weapons and against imposing sanctions. Sanctions mainly affect the Russian population and the Dutch economy. Prime Minister Rutte indicated that he does not even want to map the collateral damage for the Netherlands because it is a matter of principle. But one doesn't rule out the other. And so again my question: what is the collateral damage of sanctions and the delivery of weapons, and who is going to pay the price for this? The importance of the Netherlands must prevail, and this is not served by interference in this conflict. As terrible as this war is, the risk of escalation is too great and the damage to the Netherlands is enormous if we do not remain neutral. Mr. Chairman. Let us use all diplomatic means to de-escalate and let us provide humanitarian aid where necessary, but let us prevent a third world war.

78,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u27,"Last Thursday we all woke up in another Europe; a Europe of war, a Europe we thought we had left behind in the 20th century, a Europe where our freedom and security are no longer self-evident, but must be fought. Don't turn a page in our history, just a page back. Dozens of millions of Ukrainians now live in fear. They do not know if their house is still there at the end of the day, whether they will see their family, children or friends. And hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fighting for their country, for their lives and for their freedom. They stand bravely against the great Russian army. Ukrainians deserve our support and deep awe. Putin's violence is reprehensible, criminal and totally unnecessary. We wanted to solve it at the table, he wants a war. We want peace and security, he wants oppression and violence. He and his accomplices are guilty, no one else. Not Ukraine, not the West, nor the common Russian. What we need to do now is three things. One: supporting Ukraine, two: putting pressure on Russia, and three: strengthening our security. First of all. In this war, we must continue to support Ukraine in supplying weapons. The Cabinet must do everything possible now. Budget must not be an obstacle. My question is therefore: is this the case now? Isn't budget an obstacle, and if so, what is needed in the short term? We can also see that refugee flows are starting to happen. As a VVD, we always argue for care in the region. Now this is happening in Europe, this is our region. What is the Cabinet doing to help support reception in neighbouring Ukraine? And what preparations do we make to receive people here in the Netherlands in a good way? Secondly, we must continue to exert maximum pressure on Russia. I'm pleased with all the sanctions, but we're not here yet. We have to keep going. What else can we do so that Putin can't reach his reserves? Have all the current European programmes with Russia actually stopped? Can we immediately stop running software licenses, especially those used by the Russian army? And does the government also think that sanctions for Belarus should be as harsh as for Russia? Of course, Putin will fight back and we will also suffer economic damage. What is the government doing to prepare for this, especially the entrepreneurs who are hard hit by it? We must also punish the Russian military summit, which is responsible for these war crimes. Lithuania is preparing a request to the International Criminal Court. Is the Netherlands prepared to join? Thirdly, we must increase our security. NATO is a broad security ring for the Netherlands. NATO will never allow Russian tanks to drive through our streets. We therefore need to strengthen NATO at the eastern border. This has always been a priority for the VVD and it now has the highest priority. However, as the Netherlands, we are not delivering what NATO is asking of us at the moment. I can't do that anymore. Money must no longer be the problem. How much extra budget is this cabinet period needed to meet the readiness and investment that NATO is asking for? In addition, as far as the VVD is concerned, this cabinet period is at least 2%. The risk of Putin re-attacking, possibly due to cyber attacks on the West, is very high. He's already enlisting hacker groups. My question to the cabinet is what we are countering, whether we are in the highest state of preparedness, removing all the legal barriers that exist and ensuring that we bring together all the knowledge and expertise we have in the Netherlands. This is a matter of national unity. Finally. Since Thursday we live in a different Europe. Let this really be a wake-up call. This Russia under Putin is no longer a partner, but an enemy of our free and secure society. This requires more investment in defence, less dependence on Russian gas and unanimity with our allies.

That's not gonna happen. It may, of course, be that we now have to supply military goods to be issued or that some instruction is needed in the vicinity of Ukraine.

80,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u34,"Mr. Chairman. Ukraine is being torn apart, but the Ukrainians are fighting back bravely. Zelensky said on Wednesday in his speech addressed to the Russian people: ""We do not attack, we defend ourselves. If you attack us, you will see our faces. Not our backs, but our faces."" So far, this mentality has kept Ukraine going. Russia is progressing hard and suffering heavy losses. Colonels Russian military vehicles have been destroyed. There is already a high price Putin is paying for his military raid. An invasion that is clearly a flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and an invasion that is therefore also rightly condemned, including by me on behalf of the PVV. The PVV also disgusts Putin's blunt aggression. But the big question now is, of course, how to proceed? To answer that question, you should be able to look into Putin's head, but that gift has not been given to anyone. What we do know is that disgusting words haven't helped at all before. And sanctions haven't helped either. Former so-called ""Minister of Foreign Affairs' of the so-called ""Minister of Foreign Affairs' of the so-called ""Minister of Foreign Affairs' of the so-called ""Minister of Foreign Affairs' of the so-called ""Minister of Foreign Affairs' of the so-called ""Minister of It is therefore pointless to repeat this old strategy of sanctions now on a mega scale. Putin is at his own discretion on a historic mission and has prepared for huge sacrifices. The question is whether we should sacrifice our own economy. Not as far as the PVV is concerned, but the government has opted for a war of sanctions, so that Dutch people who are already on the brink of water are financially pushed into the abyss even further. The Prime Minister has been busy with foreign affairs for the past week, but the Dutch citizen is also here, I say. Putin's aggression is instantly leading to high costs, starting with the gas bill. Think also of the Dutch, I say. Is the government prepared to set the VAT rate for energy at 0% in this emergency scenario? Does the Cabinet embrace this PVV proposal? Mr. Chairman. The PVV foresees that with the heavy sanctions we are heading for a dark scenario, with one escalation following the other very quickly. We know, of course, that the Russian raid is not going well as planned, and that is good news, but tickling the Russian bear behind the eyes can lead to a huge disaster. That's why you don't do that. Don't do anything, I say in the direction of the cabinet, as Mrs von der Leyen, who, without a mandate from anyone, suddenly calls for EU membership to be offered to Ukraine. That is a huge provocation and oil on the fire, and there is no point in doing so now. Mr. Chairman. The beginning of the end of a military encounter often starts with diplomacy. Therefore, I say in the direction of the cabinet, put everything in place so that it can be returned to it. Is the government prepared to make the promotion of negotiations a priority so that people's suffering can be put to an immediate end?",True,0.116,0.808,0.076,-0.9818,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 56, Session 3 (2022-02-28)",2022-02-28,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 56,Sitting 2022-02-28,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,PVV,Partij voor de Vrijheid,Opposition,Right to far-right,RaymonddeRoon,"de Roon, Raymond",M,1952,70.0,False,2
81,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u47,"Mr. Chairman. It is important that we are together today to show that we are united and strong, that we do not let ourselves be separated. I have been very impressed over the last few days by how the Ukrainian people stand up under the leadership of their President. How people without military training pick up weapons. How they sometimes walk without weapons towards tanks and address military forces. How they, I wouldn't say without fear, but with all the fear they feel, still feel they have to defend their country. There are not only refugees leaving Ukraine, but also people entering Ukraine to defend their country. It is our great task to support them in this. Fortunately, there are not many politicians here in the Chamber; I am now looking to the right who say ""do we just have to do it to help the Ukrainians?', I say: this is about so much more than Ukraine. What is at stake here is our international legal order, the idea that peoples have the right to self-determination, the idea that after the Second World War we developed together that we respect borders, that we do not invade other countries. Do not pretend that Europe or the Netherlands do not want to take the diplomatic path. That's what we always want. We've gone to so much trouble to come to the table and stay with the Russians. They don't want to. And if they don't want and escalate, there's only one answer, and that's that we have zero doubt to stand up. I am also extremely pleased with the European Union's response. We fully support all sanctions. We support the supply of arms by the Netherlands and the European Union. I say that we will support all the steps needed to bring this conflict to an end. I also think we should do more. It is not only about freezing assets of Russian oligarchs, but also about the money flowing through the Netherlands via the Zuidas. Take it. We must be open to refugees and help the countries at the borders to receive shelter, but we must also be ready to receive people here. And it is time for stronger defence cooperation in Europe. It is a lot about the budget, about how much we spend here in the Netherlands, but in the end Europe already spends seven times as much on defence as Russia. We need to work even better together and it is time to speed up all the discussions on the defence union and European armies. Mr. Chairman. We also need to look at the domestic consequences. This is gonna be a long fight, but eventually we're gonna win him. But the consequences for the Netherlands will be enormous. I am in favour of a boycott of Russian gas and oil. It is indigestible that 600 million dollars are still flowing daily towards the Russian Federation. We have to stop doing that. This will have unprecedented consequences for gas and energy prices in Europe, not only in the Netherlands. I am thinking mainly of Italy and Germany. But we have to do it. That's why I'm looking at the cabinet: what is needed? I have to remember the declaration of government. I started my contribution by saying that it is strange to talk about a government statement and government plans for the coming years when you know what is happening at the Russian border. I couldn't imagine it was gonna happen at the time. But it means that a little messing with purchasing power is really not enough. It requires a very thorough review of how we look at the Dutch plans to ensure that our Dutch people can actually see the firm approach we have to choose. Mr. Chairman. I'll come to a conclusion. We must protect ourselves from the attack on our democracy, both on the outside and on the inside. That is why I will also call for a wide-ranging study to be carried out on the financing of political parties and politicians and the links there are with Russia. I will also propose to you, President, that, should confidential briefings continue to be made to the House of Representatives, parties such as the Forum for Democracy and the PVV should be excluded. At present in history we cannot have this bargaining in our own parliament and we must protect ourselves not only against the Russians, but also from interference here in the Netherlands.",True,0.059,0.826,0.115,0.9932,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 56, Session 3 (2022-02-28)",2022-02-28,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 56,Sitting 2022-02-28,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,GL,GroenLinks,Opposition,Centre-left to left,JesseKlaver,"Klaver, Jesse",M,1986,36.0,False,2

These words by the Resistanceman and founder of Vrij Nederland, Hendrik van Randwijk, we had to think about last Thursday. A pitch black day for Ukraine and Europe. The raid in Ukraine is illegal, unscrupulous and irresponsible. A flagrant violation of international law. A step back in the past of the Cold War. Firstly, I would like to express our condolences and our unconditional support for the people and leaders of Ukraine, as well as, of course, for the Ambassador. They're brave. Their struggle for freedom and democracy is ours. Their call for peace and justice is ours. We stand alongside the Ukrainians in their struggle for these shared values. President Zelensky's courage and wisdom give hope. His performance is reasonable and worthy. The contrast with Putin cannot be greater. This is Putin's war once and again. Putin's war is illegal. Because he puts power above the law. Because there was no threat from Ukraine. Genocide and denazification as false pretenses without any evidence. Flowers at the Ukrainian Embassy in Russia. Brave protesters in Russia. A mother with an infant on her arm being evicted. Can Putin count on the support of his own people? Putin's agenda wasn't a state secret. He wants Russia as superpower and former states such as Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan and above all Ukraine as satellites. We know that since the invasion of Georgia and the occupation of Crimea. At every election, with the SGP, we advocated a greater budget for our armed forces. That is why, in the negotiations, we have also set out for a structural increase and a substantial increase in money. Fortunately, Germany has chosen to do so since yesterday. With the raid in Ukraine, we are at a crossroads in our history. This calls for a rapid and united response from the world community. The CDA Group gives the cabinet the support and mandate to act proactively. More than ever, it is important that the European Union and NATO act together and decisively to ensure that Putin fails in his mission. I have been surprised that we are openly communicating about the exact delivery of military equipment. They know that in Moscow now. The CDA Group supports the sanctions package that has been announced, including for Belarus. Bite them where the pain needs to be felt. And I'll take one more step. Where does the cabinet see room for effective additions? We are thinking of SWIFT, of freezing the assets of European daughters of, for example, Gazprom and of secondary sanctions, such as the UN that applies to Iran. The war is going to have major humanitarian consequences. That is why we must help the people of Ukraine with humanitarian aid and medical devices. For private initiatives, we would like to have a coordination point at Foreign Affairs. It is heartwarming to see these initiatives. We must prepare for the reception of refugees in our own region. Are there any agreements on this in Europe? A war like this leads to unbelievable suffering. Putin is threatening nuclear weapons now. However, we must always keep the path of dialogue open. What possibilities does the cabinet see for this? We need to think about what this conflict means to our country, our security and our operational readiness. How can we become less dependent on our food, industry and energy? How do we ensure that Europe is not trampled between superpowers with their own ambitions and interests? We would like a European Security Council. How does the cabinet view this?

They're words from the Ukrainian national anthem. And how different that sounds in these dark days. Our deep respect goes out to all those in Ukraine who so courageously defend their country and our prayers go out to the relatives of the victims and to those who now know so threatened. Russia has invaded Ukraine with raw and inconspicuous display of power. Let it be said again, even from this place: it is an unacceptable and flagrant violation of the security and self-determination of a sovereign country. This was rightly condemned by the Netherlands in the strongest possible terms. The war initiated by Russia is a direct threat to security and international law in the Netherlands, in Europe and in the world. Mr. Chairman. In this light, the SGP Group is also committed to expressing support for the government's commitment to sanctions, the delivery of military goods, the provision of humanitarian aid, cooperation on the reception of refugees. Unfortunately, when it comes to sanctions, we have to be honest about the fact that it is not possible to prevent us all from feeling financial pain in the Netherlands and Europe. At the same time, it is a good thing that we are always carefully and as well weighted as possible to ensure that these sanctions affect Putin and his cabal as much as possible, instead of shooting in our own foot. My question is therefore how we can work together with the allies to find ways to minimise the economic pain for our own citizens, farmers and entrepreneurs. Mr. Chairman. It is a good thing that energy security and energy prices are clearly the focus of the cabinet and that we do not literally leave citizens and businesses in the cold. We would say: let us indeed make extra work of reducing our vulnerable dependence on Russian gas as quickly as possible. Mr. Chairman. The situation around Ukraine shows us all how important it was, is and remains to invest in defence. That is why we are calling for more money to be made available for our defence, for our armed forces and at least for the 2% we simply agreed on in NATO. I'd like to hear the government's reaction to that. I would also like to draw attention to the invisible battle that is now raging in the cyber world, the hackers that are also controlled from the Kremlin. My question to the cabinet is whether it wants to do everything that is necessary, including in rapid legislative adjustment, to give our security services sufficient space. Our impression is, also on the basis of the evaluation report, that they are now too strict, too tight, and that it is important to have sufficient space in that cyber domain. Mr. Chairman. The big question is, what's next? Let us stand side by side with the Ukraine, but also with NATO members who feel very threatened by recent developments. Let us support diplomatic efforts for peace, but within the limits of the international legal order. Keeping our heads cool, being decisive, but keeping us far away, even at EU level, from promises and statements that create false hopes and can work as oil on the fire. That is what this is all about. The evil, the injustice and the lust for power: it is great, it can be great, but it has no future in the end. Every power, no matter how intimidating, will once fade and sink.

84,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u59,"Thank you, Madam President. My speech consists of two elements. Those are the two elements you need, I think, to find the best way out of a situation like the one we're in right now. The first element is: how did we get here? What exactly is going on here? And the second is: what is the best way to find a solution from the situation we are now in? It is with great regret that I noticed last week that we were so right in our campaign against that stupid association agreement in 2015 and 2016. Precisely the two things that we warned against in the early days of the Forum for Democracy, when we were not yet a party in the Chamber but were campaigning against the Treaty during the referendum, were EU membership and NATO membership. Those two things are getting much closer to the association agreement, so we warned, and that is going to lead to conflict, to war. That does not work; do not do it, we said, for it is very unwise. At that time, we found Frits Bolkestein, among others, by our side, who had written in several newspapers: comply with the Minsk agreements. These Minsk agreements stated, among other things, that Ukraine should be federalised. It was not therefore necessary to make a single state with one language and one jurisdiction and so on, but all these different areas had to be given their sovereignty, self-determination and language rights, and other rights, such as their own tax system and their own television stations. That never happened, quite the contrary. Over the last few months, Ukraine has closed down four opposition television stations, as is happening in the European Union. Times change, let's just say. So there have been very clear warnings from our side and from Frits Bolkestein, but also from John Mearsheimer, a well-known politician from the United States. All these people said: don't do this, because it's incredibly unwise, and if you do it anyway... Since 2015 that has only happened more. Last summer, in July, NATO reiterated in Brussels that Ukraine will indeed become a member of NATO. There will be military exercises and 43 billion US arms subsidies have gone to Ukraine. So it is quite clear that that is politics. And it is also quite clear that this is unacceptable for Russia. If you have that situation, then you can have two... I come to hear your interruption, Mrs. Mulder. So there are two things you can do. And then I'd like to quote a man I've known, Johan Cruijff. Of course, that was a very interesting man, who could look at things completely brilliantly. It was about all kinds of political issues and he said, ""I know one thing. If I want to cross a certain intersection with a bike, I can theoretically have the priority rules on my side hundreds of thousands of times, but if a truck crosses from the left at 200 kilometers per hour, I'm going to brake."" Well, that's realistic geopolitics. That is a realistic political strategy. And that is, consciously or unconsciously, I would like to say something about it in a moment, completely ignored and trampled on. Fools rushed in! As stupid, naive children who recreated a James Bond movie ran the Yankees towards Ukraine, and look at the result.

God, I know you are with us in your habitation in heaven. Joy and peace have bestowed upon you. You gave your life for the people, wrote them in the book of life. Mr. Chairman. These are some words from a song that Ukrainian Christians, hiding in a subway tunnel, sang on the first day of Russia's terrible attack on Ukraine. In recent days, we have seen a tremendous perseverance and courage of the Ukrainian people: a people and a president who stand and are willing to die for their country and for values of freedom. To the Ambassador, who is present today, I would like to say that we express our support for the people of Ukraine and our solidarity with them. Mr. Chairman. There is a lot of courage, but there is also a lot of suffering, fear and a feeling of uncertainty. This feeling of powerlessness and uncertainty is also felt far beyond Ukraine's borders worldwide, because not only the future of Ukraine, but also the future of the free world is at stake. If we do not respond adequately and steadfastly to this violation of the international legal order and putin can get away with it, this can also happen in other areas and in other sovereign countries. We're already being warned about this. Today we are talking about the people of Ukraine, perhaps tomorrow we are talking about the Baltic States, Georgia or Moldova, the day after tomorrow Taiwan and other parts of the world, because the rule of law has not been able to respond adequately. Mr. Chairman. We stand not for a rule of law where the power of the strongest prevails, but for a rule of law and justice. In times of great uncertainty, prayer for peace, like that with which I began, is a great good that we may cherish. At the same time, peace must be accompanied by decisive action, courageous steps and the unity of the international legal order. The Christian Union Group states that now that Putin has decided to withdraw from this international legal order, maximum isolation is the only correct answer. Putin has tried everything to cause division, but fortunately he has achieved the opposite. The growing solidarity and unity of the European Member States and NATO Member States, the establishment of a sanction package and support for Ukraine in the financial and military fields as well as in other areas show the resilience of the international community. Mr. Chairman. The Christian Union is pleased that there is a sanction package. The Christian Union is still looking specifically at a number of firmer measures, in which the Netherlands can also take steps. For example, how does the Minister look at the monitoring of the Zuidas and other places where Russian state-owned companies may be hiding assets and assets? The British Government announced today that it wants to put an end to the circumspect constructions that allow foreign, Russian, billionaires to manage possessions and conceal possessions, for example by placing them with letterbox companies. Can I get a commitment that the Minister will look at this seriously, quickly and adequately? Mr. Chairman. There are other options on the table. How, for example, does the Minister look at the recall of the Dutch ambassador in Russia, together with other countries? Is it not the right time, if necessary with a number of countries, to bring a state complaint to the European Court of Human Rights? Is it possible to put Russia from an international perspective, such as PACE and Interpol? I would like to hear the Minister's views on these proposals. Mr. Chairman. Today there are talks going on between Russia and Ukraine. That's hopeful. What does the cabinet expect from this effort? What will the Netherlands still be able to do or facilitate at diplomatic level? Mr. Chairman. It is important that we become independent of Russian gas from Gazprom and associates. The motion Grinwis c.s. called for this, too. How's the cabinet looking at this? What are the steps taken here, including with regard to municipalities that have contracts? Mr President, I will conclude. Good, the call for generosity in the reception of refugees. I understand by now that, on the basis of the treaty concluded with Ukraine, they are allowed to stay for 90 days. But that is a difference with an application through the asylum rules, including with regard to finances and support.

This conflict will continue to affect Europe in the coming years. We must therefore work towards sustainable solutions. To this end, we must also ask ourselves how we got here. In 2013, the Ukrainians were on Maidan Square, on which Putin reacted with unrest in the Donbass and the annexation of Crimea. Putin fears a free European Ukraine, and thus this war at its core is also a European conflict. But too often Europe did not honour its promise of freedom, equality and prosperity and had to abandon European values for political calculations and lobbying interests. The EU now has an opportunity to put European values first. In doing so, we must make choices that will hurt in the short term but will strengthen Europe in the long term. Mr. Chairman. Too often economic interests are the guiding principle rather than values and solidarity. As a result, our economies are heavily dependent on Russian gas and money. This makes us vulnerable. Is the government therefore prepared to make every effort to strengthen European strategic autonomy by investing more in renewable energy, jointly purchasing gas and building up gas reserves? Will the Minister argue in favour of using the Social Climate Fund to compensate for rising oil and gas prices? In addition, billions of Russian investments flow through the Netherlands every year, 89% of which reach a letterbox company. Does the government agree with Volt that this is the time to put an end to all letterbox companies? Mr. Chairman. It is heartening to see that Europe and Europeans are working together for refugees at the external borders, but the pressure on the border countries will continue to grow. Poland captures the vast majority of refugees. Hungary is in favour of the European Temporary Protection Directive and Sweden is in favour of compulsory relocation. Is the cabinet prepared to respond immediately to both calls and take a leading role in them at European level? In addition, this crisis exposes the lack of a European defence force. The use of military equipment and the contribution that the Netherlands is making to it are a good first step, as are the 20,000 soldiers who will now defend the eastern borders. But once again this requires a structural investment in our future and our autonomy. Will the Netherlands follow the German example and finally make a structural commitment to the NATO standard?

90,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u150,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am making my contribution today on behalf of the BBB Group. Russia has violated international law. It bombed cities and invaded Ukraine without cause. This is the biggest crisis since the Cuba crisis, as JA21 said. It is essential to enforce international law. Are the evidence gathered and we are helping Ukraine to ratify the Treaty of Rome as soon as possible, to ensure that the war criminals will also be punished? Or else should we set up an ad hoc tribunal? Mr. Chairman. The freezing of funds is a good first step, but these assets should not be frozen, but expropriated and placed in a trust fund. From there, the Russian assets of the oligarchs can be paid for the reconstruction of Ukraine. They should not be paid by the working Dutch or Russian people. Does the government intend to take the initiative? The Netherlands must also play an active role in the vanguard of diplomacy and stay ahead of it. This includes initiatives to offer Putin a way out behind the scenes. We are learning a hard geopolitical lesson: this conflict can have very bad turns over the coming hours, days, weeks and months. We may not be able to get any more energy. We could be dealing with violent cyber attacks. Is the crisis infrastructure now active, and do we not wait until it is really necessary, as with corona? As the Netherlands and the EU, we have become far too dependent and need to work on food security and security of energy and raw materials. We neglected that. And who coordinates that in the Netherlands? The war, inflation and sanctions cause acute pain, including in the Netherlands. Multinationals were helped in the corona crisis. Bankers were helped in the banking crisis. Now households that have an acute problem with their energy bills need to be helped. What's the government gonna do? This is not just about people at the welfare level. Mr. Chairman. Putin has achieved one incredible thing: 27 united EU countries. That's very difficult. The Prime Minister knows that. This unity is important, but the EU should not become a military organisation at once or offer frivolous memberships. Bilateral aid to Ukraine: sure. But we can regret weapons via the EU or memberships.

91,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u152,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With the Russian invasion last week, 43 million Ukrainians fell victim to a terrible war. It is absolutely reprehensible that Putin has committed this attack and this violence without any cause. I would like to express my solidarity with the Ukrainian citizens and all those who are in Ukraine, and my condolences to the families of the dead who have already died as a result of this horrible violence. Mr. Chairman. Let's give top priority to protecting those 43 million citizens. There is a humanitarian disaster at the moment. That is not solved with a Dutch shipment of guns or missiles. We need a ceasefire immediately. It is good to hear that the cabinet is spending 20 million on humanitarian aid, but that alone is not enough. Aid organisations must be free to go and their staff must be able to work safely. How will the Minister make efforts to support a free and secure passage for aid organisations? And does he intend to invest in local humanitarian organisations so that they can act quickly, with the right knowledge of the area? And in what other ways is the Minister going to work for the protection of citizens? Mr. Chairman. With the attack on Ukraine, Putin is violating humanitarian law. It is a good thing that the Minister wants the investigation of war crimes following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How will the Minister contribute to this? And is he willing to invest in local human rights organisations that can support this? The question also arises: how is the Minister going to guarantee that the military equipment we are sending is not being used to deal with civilian casualties? Mr. Chairman. If we are able to send weapons to a conflict area as quickly as possible, then we must also assume our responsibility to provide Ukrainian refugees with a safe haven in the Netherlands as soon as possible. The activation of the EU's temporary protection directive is a good start. I would like to hear what this means in the Netherlands in terms of procedure and rights for Ukrainians who are looking for a safe place here and whether this is given priority over the moratorium that has just been established. I would also like to hear from the cabinet when it can inform the Chamber again about the extension of reception in the Netherlands. It seems to me to be absolutely urgent to do so, given that the present reception is already inadequate. I would also like to hear what commitments the Netherlands wants to make with regard to the distribution of reception among EU Member States, so that Poland and Hungary can be relieved in the long term. I also have questions about how Poland is receiving people fleeing Ukraine. At first I saw this as warm and generous, but in recent days we have also received reports that a distinction is made on the basis of colour, nationality and ethnicity at the border. I would also like to know a little more about that. Mr. Chairman. We see a strong EU commitment to sanctions against Russia, especially towards Russian oligarchy. The Netherlands is guilty of enriching that same oligarchy. We know from the FinCEN reports of 2020 that ING was a hub in Russian money laundering. Follow the Money has repeatedly addressed the role of the Zuidas and enriching the Russian oligarchy. It seems that direct family members of Mr Putin are gathering land and property here in our country. How will the Minister prevent Dutch companies and banks from now and in the future being guilty of the wealth and power of the oligarchs? Is the Minister prepared to conduct extensive research into links between Dutch companies and Russian actors contributing to the emerging conflict? Is he also willing to look at the long term, at the bigger picture? The welcoming of the newly emerging, unbridled capitalism from Russia, which has been so warmly welcomed in the West, makes these abuses financially possible.

Last Thursday morning at 3:30 p.m., still in the darkness of the night, thousands of Ukrainians were violently awakened by the explosions of Russian missiles. Less than a week ago, but the world before that no longer exists. With this cowardly and cruel act of war, the whole of Europe is in a different reality. War, many speakers have said it is back on our continent. Over the last few days, we have all seen the horrible images of airports and troops in streets, places where they absolutely do not belong. I would like to repeat in this House what I said a number of times before: this is an attack on Ukraine, but also a frontal attack on our peace, our stability and our continent. And it's all very well, let there be no misunderstanding about that. It's a flagrant violation of international law and of all the agreements we stand for in the Netherlands, in Europe and in NATO. We cannot and will not accept that. Mr. Chairman. We have seen more over the past week, and it is good to mention that. I would also like to say this to the Ambassador again this morning, personally, that I have great, great, great respect for the determination, courage and solidarity shown by the men and women in Ukraine. I feel that this is widespread in the Chamber, and I honestly think that is an example and an inspiration for all of us. Whatever we have seen, I shall say more about this in a moment. It is a measure of unity, of shoulder to shoulder in Europe and also with the allies in North America, which, frankly, has been a long way to go in the past. And that has also enabled us to put together a very substantial package of sanctions at great speed. And we have seen a very great degree of solidarity, of the people in our country, but also around the world. We have also seen that NATO is currently strengthening its eastern flank and the Netherlands is contributing to this. This also increases our resilience as an alliance. And yes, Putin may be taking countermeasures and there will be consequences for us. The Prime Minister also referred to this. I will deal with all these blocks later, but what we are doing, Mr President, is much broader. As the Netherlands, as the European Union, as the international community and as NATO, we are committed to political and economic measures and we are looking at the humanitarian side of the matter. As the Netherlands, we have done all our fair share in the field of arms supplies. We are dealing with human rights and refugees. As far as we are concerned, all registers will be opened. Mr. Chairman. First of all, I would like to say something about diplomacy and the diplomatic side. I would also like to talk about international law. Two are the sanctions, three the energy and the economic impact, four humanitarian and refugees and five others. The Minister of Defence will take care of the questions specific to the military, and I believe the Prime Minister will answer a relatively limited number of questions about his contacts with Putin, accession and a number of other issues. Mr. Chairman. So I'll start with the block diplomatically. Mrs Mulder but also Mr De Roon asked: can we keep the dialogue open? What possibilities do we see for that? I would like to repeat what I have always said, namely that the cabinet, before the war began, has always said that the best way forward was one of de-escalation and diplomatic contact. The resumption of dialogue is always sensible, but I would add that we will of course take very close account of the position of Ukraine itself, because it has changed. Russia has chosen a completely different path. It has all the other possibilities to continue the dialogue, not want to use it and get it right. In all these forums in which there was talk of Normandy format, directly with the United States, all kinds of other channels by official means, but also all kinds of informal contacts, which we all know have been there, there has been a completely different picture than what has happened now. So yeah, we're moving on. We will always be open to this dialogue ourselves, but we will always be as a warned person and in close consultation with our partners in Europe and North America, of course, but also with Ukraine itself. Mrs Mulder referred to a European Security Council. That is indeed the intention of the cabinet. We are of course also in contact with European partners on this issue. At the same time, that is not something you know from one day to the next, because we must, of course, first get the best out of the crisis as it is now. She also asked: how do you ensure that the European Union is not trampled between the great powers? As far as I am concerned, Europe has taken a positive surprise over the last week and a half, by sitting very fast in the sanctions and serving them with great unity. If you had asked most observers just a week ago, they probably wouldn't have thought that possible. I think that is a real gain, because we all know, also from the national context: it is not that easy to agree with a very large group. Mr. Chairman. Mr Ceder asked about the possibility of evicting Russia from an international perspective. He mentioned, for example, the Parliamentary Assembly. I very much understand that thought, but that is up to the Parliamentary Assembly itself. They shall decide on the exclusion of the Russian delegation. He also asked about Interpol. I would like to agree with him that I will pass his question on to the Minister of Justice, because we have just not been able to find out at all speed. I would really like to be able to weigh up the repercussions of that. Mr. Chairman. Mr Brekelmans asked the also very understandable question whether the Netherlands would like to join a request from Ukraine to Russia at the International Court of Justice. I think it is a good thing that Ukraine has started a business there. We will follow that process closely. Legally, Ukraine has now requested provisional measures. That's what the court's gonna look at first. If the Court ruled that the case was admissible, the Netherlands could intervene if necessary thereafter.

And this is very important, because there will be a moment when the conflict is over, and then we want to be able to hold those responsible responsible for it responsible. So yes to Mr Brekelmans' question, but there are more strikes to this question and I would really like to explore them all. Mr. Chairman. Mr Kuzu asked whether we would also like to launch an investigation into the use of illegal weapons. I think he mentioned cluster munitions. Neither Russia nor Ukraine are partners in the convention on cluster munitions. But here again, as I have just said, we will examine and do more than our part in all possible violations of humanitarian war law.

At the same time, the last thing I want us to do is to walk through a process because of our own diplomatic ambitions and to do something that would potentially not be in Ukraine's interest. There's a lot of contact. The Prime Minister is in contact with Zelensky. I had contact with my colleague through the app, even during this debate. If we are to provide that kind of opportunity where we can help, that is the case in this case, but that is also the case more widely, if we can be postillon d'amour or bring parties together in any other way, then we will never fail to do so, but we will do so only if it is useful. Mr. Chairman. Mr De Roon asked if we were prepared to promote negotiations to put an end to people's suffering. That is, of course, what is most important to us all: the suffering of citizens, who have not earned it in any way. But that doesn't mean that the blame lies a little in the middle. There's one aggressor. There is one country that has taken an attack and is bombing without any reasonable motive. So yes, we would like to play a role, but I also have to refer to Mr Van Dijk's answer on what the Netherlands can do there. I have also answered Mr Van Dijk's question on the state of the negotiations. Mr. Chairman. Mr Sjoerdsma asked what the cabinet is doing to support Ukraine. That's actually the whole palette I just sketched. I'd like to walk it through the different blocks. It is a question of military support, which the Minister of Defence can deal with in detail in a moment. It is about humanitarian aid, it is about economic aid and it is about political support. As far as I am concerned, we will continue on each of these fronts. I will, of course, return to the refugees in a moment. Mr. Chairman. I have just asked Mr Brekelmans about the International Criminal Court. It was asked: is international law at issue here? Yes, of course. There's just a restraining order in the UN Charter. There is therefore no misunderstanding about this. We have dealt with Clustermunity, and so have the International Court of Justice. Mr. Chairman. That brings me to the second block, on sanctions. A lot of questions have been asked about that. Some of the questions were directed towards the possible collateral damage and the consequences it could have for the Netherlands. Following the Prime Minister's example, I would like to pour ready-made wine on the front. This is only secondary about the wallets. This is about a matter of principle. This is about peace and security. That affects all of us. So I have always argued in Europe that we should opt for a very, very substantial package of sanctions. In doing so, you have to take into account the possibility of 'probability' or perhaps you have to say 'probability' that Russia will reflect on it and will also impose sanctions on Europe. If that happens, you must also take into account unbalanced effects for some Member States that are more affected than others. It is not at all unthinkable, given the trade volumes that the Netherlands has with Russia, that the Netherlands will also be severely affected. However, I think it is right that you should say together in Europe: 'We are going to carry together, shoulder to shoulder, the burden of any retalation. We are going to make sure that we help those most affected where necessary."" But that cannot and should not be a reason to lower the level of sanctions. That would really be putting the horse behind the cart.

The cabinet is certainly prepared to do that. Moreover, I think it would be wise to do so in a European context as well. Mr. Chairman. Mr Van Dijk asked: how do sanctions affect the oligarchs? It is not about such a large group, but even if it is only moral, it is very important to me. That is exactly why we have expanded this group every time.

In my contribution, I asked the Minister whether he also intends to invest in local humanitarian organisations so that they can act quickly because of course they know the area well. The open question was: in what other ways is the Minister going to work for the protection of citizens?

It can even lead to victims on their own side, because every war is also characterized by what lies under that always misleading term ""friendly fire."" So I just agree with her. Nevertheless, I think we should do it in the balance of things. Then there is her question: do we want to make a broader effort for the people of Ukraine and for their position? I'd love to.

It should be clear that the NATO countries will not intervene in Ukraine in a military manner. We're not gonna do that. Ukraine is not covered by Article 5. What we are doing is helping massively: with financial support, with humanitarian aid, with arms supplies to Ukraine that allow them to defend themselves and with economic and financial sanctions aimed at the Moscow regime as much as possible, not at the ordinary Russians. That's what we're doing now. Ultimately, of course, the goal is to arrive at a de-escalation of this crisis in the long term, but that can only happen if Russia withdraws fully from Ukraine. A complete withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine: that is, of course, an absolute precondition. If that happens, the conversation can be resumed, after, of course, the discussion about the enormous humanitarian damage that has been done in Ukraine has first been held. But one way or another, a discussion with the Russians will have to be resumed on how to reach more structural agreements on mutual security guarantees in this part of the world.

Do I not really know anymore about issues relating to Ukraine's accession to the European Union or not? I do not think that is a good discussion at the moment. A discussion that I consider to be much more relevant, which I have had with Zelensky, but also with the Presidents of Moldova and Georgia, is about how we can ensure that we as the European Union are much more committed to these three countries, that we recognise their ambition to focus on Europe and that we look together with them at ways of making use of all the opportunities that still exist in the Eastern Partnership to achieve even more intensive cooperation with these countries. I do not think it makes sense now to talk about the desirability or not of full accession of these countries to the European Union. This does not seem to me to be the time. But it is time to consider what scope exists within the existing association agreements. These countries need to see what we can do in the short term to help the populations of these countries, Ukraine, but I really add Georgia and Moldova, because that is where the fear is now that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with them, that we aim to ensure that the violence in Ukraine stops and that the perceived threat towards Moldova and Georgia disappears again.",True,0.054,0.866,0.08,0.7577,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 56, Session 3 (2022-02-28)",2022-02-28,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 56,Sitting 2022-02-28,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,MarkRutte,"Rutte, Mark",M,1967,55.0,False,2

Decision-making is currently taking place in the Intelligence and Security Council and a special sub-committee on Ukraine with the most concerned ministers. It has been coming together very frequently for weeks; twice this week, tomorrow and Thursday. We are also in permanent contact with each other. In the various ministries, all preparations are also made with the vital sectors and the decentralised government to be prepared in the event of developments requiring a response. If that is the reason, I can decide at any time with the Minister of Justice and Security to allow the national crisis structure to enter into force. The introduction of this structure must have added value and it does not currently have it in relation to existing structures. Once again, there may be a more acute situation, and that structure would be useful because it would ensure rapid integrated decision-making in the event of concrete threats. But that is not the issue at the moment. Finally, Mr Van Haga's question as to whether I am prepared to play a neutral role in the negotiations with Ukraine in the near future. Maybe I can say the following. We're not neutral. We're gonna find some of this. I made this perfectly clear in my speech this morning on behalf of the cabinet. Putin goes far, far beyond what we feared, including the nuclear threat he added yesterday. The time of hope, watch and wait is over.

Our European security structure is literally under attack. What seemed unimaginable for a long time has now become reality. I too would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with Ukraine. We see people there leaving their home and fireplace, we see them in shelters, we see rockets crashing and tanks driving through the streets. And we also see massive resistance from the Ukrainian people and from the armed forces. I find that impressive and courageous. I am also deeply concerned about the people of Ukraine and the military who are defending their country there. It also feels powerless to stand here. At the same time, there is much we can do. I would like to respond to that, because we are not abandoning Ukraine. We need to show Putin that the road he's taken is a dead end. Of course, I also have contact with our own soldiers.

Of course, that's something I have monitored closely. I understand Mrs Piri's question, but at the moment I cannot say that. Let's agree that I'll inform the Chamber about this kind of thing, publicly if possible and confidentially if necessary. Maybe I can just keep going right now. Mrs Piri rightly said that we see the situation unfolding. The situation is, of course, constantly evolving. We know that at present the regional capitals are still under Ukraine's control, that there is strong pressure from Russian land-based units and components and that there is also an intensification of the Russian operation. This can change at any time. We work cards. I have here a map that is unclassified, I say to everyone who has questions about it, on which we keep a close eye on the military developments and thus remain up-to-date on these developments. But it is also important to say that I will only be able to come out with information if it is also confirmed on our side. This is very often not the case at the time when social media or the media are reporting on matters. The situation as I know it now is that the Russian forces have not yet managed to reach Kiev, but that they are approaching close. The front line is about 25 kilometers northwest of Kiev. That means they've reached the edge of the suburbs of Kiev. Then back to what it was often about today, the nuclear threat. Indeed, if Putin announces that the Russian strategic nuclear deterrent force will be put in a higher state of preparedness, it will be the first time since the end of the Cold War that the state of preparedness of the Russian strategic nuclear force will be increased by the public and in a conflict situation. That is a political signal that is clear and extremely worrying. With this step, I think we can say that Putin has just crossed a line again. This also shows the contours of a new post-conflict security paradigm. We are, of course, very concerned about that. At the same time, it is also incredibly important that we de-escalate, call for de-escalation and not go along in another step on the escalation ladder. Mr Van Dijk's question, which was on this subject, I should like to answer in this way. It's very disturbing, it's also unacceptable. We take it seriously, but we remain calm in our alliance and we do what needs to be done. What needs to be done is to give that support to Ukraine. We have also informed you over the last few days about what the Netherlands is doing. We have informed you about the weapons and military goods that the Netherlands supplies to Ukraine. The provision of such military support remains of real importance in the current circumstances. That is firstly because it enables Ukraine to exercise its legitimate right to self-defense. They have that legitimate right. Perhaps I can say that in addition to what has just been said in the debate on the interruption. Countries under attack have a legitimate right to self-defense. The aid we are sending is actually determined by Ukraine's demand. We are in contact with the Ukrainians about this. The additional material that has been made available in recent days indicates the seriousness of the situation. You have seen that the Netherlands is not only in this, but that several countries are now doing so, including those that previously chose to supply non-defension equipment. We strive to deliver to the equipment as soon as possible. We do that together with allies. On Sunday afternoon, a cargo took off with an air cargo to a collection site in the border area. We're communicating about that, too. Questions have just been asked about this. It's important to communicate about that. Of course, careful consideration must always be given. Can we communicate transparently without taking operational risks? That was the case here. So transparent where you can, and if you can't, you won't hear about it. I would like to stress that communicating on this issue is firstly to support Ukraine and secondly to strengthen our message, including to Russia. Then there are questions about the effects of supplying weapons. First of all, what is the effect of displacement on one's own organisation? This has already been requested in previous debates. I have said that it is almost impossible to supply weapons, or military goods, without any kind of displacement effect. So there must be an opinion on that. The military judgment when it comes to delivering is that it's possible. I've reported that to the Chamber before, including in the letters. That was the delivery of the sniper weapons, the stinger anti-aircraft missile systems and the Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons. Then we'll address the DOD's operational stash. It has displacement effects, but they are limited. The Defense Department will ensure that those supplies are quickly replenished. Mr. Chairman. Then there is Mr Brekelmans' question as to whether the budget is perhaps an obstacle to what we can or cannot deliver. At present, the budget is not an obstacle to material support. As I said, it is made available from the stocks that are there and we are going to supplement them. In addition, we saw yesterday that the European Union took a decision on addressing the European Peace Facility. This is an aid package of 500 million, of which 450 million is intended for lethal aid. The remaining 50 million is for fuel, medical facilities, protective clothing and that sort of thing. What we've already delivered, we've covered from the cabinet. That's what the Chamber was informed about. We're still looking for additional supplies. In that case, it will also be ensured that there is cover for this. Finally. Mrs Simons asked to ensure on this point that the material we send does not lead to civilian casualties. I would like to stress that we are doing this because we want to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. There is only one culprit to what is happening now, and that is Putin, who has sent his armed forces to Ukraine with these enormous amounts of weapons and units for no reason whatsoever. So it's in the context of self-defense. But, of course, in a war situation, you can never completely rule out civilian casualties. It is entirely intended that the weapons can only be used by the Ukrainian armed forces to defend themselves against the Russian armed forces. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee 100%. This whole war, of course, has enormous risks and requires victims on the Ukrainian side. We're just watching it happen.",True,0.089,0.837,0.074,-0.9809,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 56, Session 3 (2022-02-28)",2022-02-28,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 56,Sitting 2022-02-28,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,2
108,ParlaMint-NL_2022-02-28-tweedekamer-3.u325,"It's hard to say. At least it's not a matter of weeks or weeks. What can be a matter of short notice is that we just don't have it anymore. But we're not the only country that supplies weapons. In the meantime, almost all European countries and other non-European NATO alliance members are doing so. So it's delivered from all sides. There is also intensive cooperation in transport and actual transfer. So a system has actually started, and I'm assuming that you can maintain such a supply for a long time to come. Of course, we do not know exactly how the situation will develop and how much longer it will be necessary. But let me say that I think that the financial bottleneck is not the first bottleneck that arises. That's more like the bottleneck of whether it's still available at all. I am talking about the short term in the long term, of course. How do you use resources and what resources do you use? But I'll get back to you on that. I would first like to say a few words about cyber, the hybrid warfare and the disinformation warfare, which we also see. I will begin with the Ukrainian request for support in cyber. That request came in on 18 February. We had talked about this before. I have already informed the Chamber that the Netherlands is participating in the EU's rapid response team. That's the PESCO project. We decided, immediately after Ukraine's request had come, with the participating countries to honour that and to activate that rapid response team led by Lithuania. There was also contact with Ukraine and a delegation was to travel to Kiev. The day the attack took place, the whole plan had to go back overboard. There's still a search for a way. The various participants in the team are in contact with each other and there is as good and as angry as that can be kept in contact with Ukraine to see how this support can be given in a different way. In any case, the Department of Defense has cybersecurity specialists available to help. That was about Ukraine's specific request. Questions have also been asked, among others, by Mr Brekelmans and Mr Van der Staaij, about what we can do at all against cyber attacks, not only in Ukraine, but also in the Netherlands. Mr Van der Staaij also added that I believe that we should not look at the legislation we have on this issue. We have already said interdepartmentally before the attack, when the whole situation began to sign off, that we need to intensify on this point; we need to take account of those cyber attacks. The Prime Minister also said just now: that is one of the scenarios we are prepared for. That is what he said in reply to Mr Omtzigt's question. The answer to that is indeed yes. So we do that interdepartmentally. Furthermore, the services are of course investigating the threat posed by countries with an offensive cyber program. We've reported that to the Chamber before. Russia is one of those countries. So cyber operations are just part of Russia's military strategy. It is very important to have the best possible view of that threat, preferably naturally before it materializes. For this purpose, the services can use different powers. They have those powers. They're in the law, too. However, we have recently noted that this was under the previous cabinet that we are currently encountering some bottlenecks in the work of the services in the cyber domain, just because of the speed. How can you do the work just as quickly as the other one, so to speak, makes the preparations? We would very much like to find a solution to this in the form of a temporary law, so that we make the work of the services and the supervisory system fit for that dynamic cyber domain. I believe that the current situation is encouraging us to proceed with this as soon as possible. Mr. Chairman. Mrs Koekkoek van Volt also asked whether Europe is taking concrete steps to improve resilience in the cyber domain and in relation to hybrid warfare. She talked about supporting independent journalism, an integrated approach to disinformation, and she also talked about the possibility of perhaps organising a supranational cyber defense. I think the strengthening of resilience is extremely important. There is the Strategic Compass that the EU is preparing now and also the NATO strategic concept in preparation. It really takes steps in the area of cybersecurity, within the EU, within NATO. The same applies to addressing disinformation. The same applies to investing in good proactive, factual communication, including from, for example, EEAS and NATO. What is not being worked on directly is a joint cyber resilience in the form of that supranational cybersecurity approach. It's complicated. International law applies, of course, also to the cyber domain, but an offensive cyber response is actually allowed in very few cases. As we work in the Netherlands, it is actually all covered by the intelligence work. The intelligence work is to a large extent a national competence. So it is very difficult to organise that supranationally. What is possible, and crucial, is that the intelligence services work together internationally. There are possibilities there. It is also possible to capture cyber effects within NATO when it comes to military missions. But that's as far as it goes. Mr Sjoerdsma suggested that more information should also be shared within NATO. Maybe I can answer that question right away. I would suggest that the Court be informed of this point through the appropriate channels. So that's a commitment I'm happy to make. Then NATO and readiness. We all saw the NATO summit last Friday. That was not only the 30 NATO alliance members, but also the High Representative of the EU. Finland was there with the Prime Minister and Sweden was there. NATO plus these three have also shown that there is consensus. NATO has once again stressed that NATO guarantees the security of all allies and that it considers cooperation with the EU, Finland and Sweden to be very important. I also believe that we must realise that the collective defence of our territory and therefore of the Netherlands can only be achieved in cooperation with others. So that's crucial. On Friday at the NATO summit, the leaders also made a political decision to enable SACEUR, the highest Allied Commander Europe, to activate NATO Response Force. That's the so-called flash power that's been reported about. SACEUR has been and immediately has been able to do so. That is, of course, a very exceptional situation, but it is important. It means that NATO can also act more quickly. That is wise in the present circumstances, I think. It's called At the Speed of Relevance in NATO language. The current circumstances justify this step, which is without precedent. It has never happened that NATO has activated this flash power, and that indicates the seriousness of the situation as far as I am concerned. Prime Minister Rutte stressed at the emergency session that the Netherlands is ready to make its military contribution to the allergic deterrent and defence. I would like to add that, of course, we always inform the Chamber. In advance if that is possible, and if it is not possible for reasons of speed and time, then at least as soon as possible. There were a number of questions about what Defense can do quickly to further increase readiness in the very short term. There are real possibilities for that. I immediately asked what they were. That is, of course, an increase in urgency in the current circumstances. In any case, we are going to ensure that we increase stocks of spare parts more quickly. We're going to continue to replenish the ammunition supplies. Where there are real problems in the mansion, we're gonna see how you can hire extra people faster. We're also going to look at strategic air transport, because there's a bottleneck there. These are the things that must be done, at least in the short term, to ensure that we can meet what NATO is asking of us. Mr. Chairman. Then there is European defence cooperation. As I said, the EU was represented at the NATO summit. Cooperation between the EU and NATO is actually more intense than ever before. Many EU Member States are members of NATO. I have seen how this whole situation has led the EU to become geopolitical. The meeting I was just at, which meant I wasn't here for a while, was a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in the composition of the Defence Ministers. I'll say something about that in a moment. However, this indicates that EU cooperation is crucial, especially if there is a problem at the edge of our European Union. We have already discussed with each other, including in the Chamber, the importance of boosting EU defence cooperation and defence policy. This concerns, for example, the joint acquisition of defence capacity through the EU and the European Defence Fund. It is also about using the European Peace Facility, which perhaps, when we spoke a week or three ago, we could not have suspected that it has already been released to supply arms to Ukraine. So that's how fast it can go. An important decision was taken yesterday by the European Council. It is also about European cooperation on the cyber domain, the hybrid threat. The Netherlands assumes its responsibility there. That's what we talked about in today's wired RBZ. We spoke, of course, about what is happening in Ukraine today. We talked about what we can do as Member States and how we can do it in a coordinated manner. I find it extraordinary how we have been able to discuss and coordinate this with each other in three days. I also find it very special, as I said, that we have now made the 500 million from the European Peace Facility available as aid to Ukraine. I think that says a great deal about European defence cooperation as it is developing and Mr Klaver pointed out, among other things. Mrs Koekkoek asked about the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Putin speaks about other countries, including Sweden and Finland. He says that if they took the step to apply for membership of NATO, it would have adverse consequences for them. Those are, of course, unacceptable statements. That has just been said by both colleagues. Each country may decide its own future and also express its interest in becoming an alliance member. Sweden and Finland are not at the moment, but they are very important partners. Gotland is a Swedish island. NATO is working militaryly with Sweden in the framework of European security. There's practice together. The JEF, the Joint Expeditionary Force, is also working with about ten Nordic countries, including Sweden and Finland. They're not members of NATO. The other JEF countries are members of NATO. But there has already been a very extensive start with mainly joint exercises. One of them is about to start again and we're just gonna keep doing that. NATO works militaryly with Sweden and the Netherlands works militaryly with Sweden. There's practice. For that particular island, Sweden has itself taken measures to strengthen it. I cannot, of course, make any further announcements about this. Sweden can always ask other countries to help. For example, Article 42.7 of the EU provides a hook for this. Mr. Chairman. Then the last part, and then maybe I'll come up with a few loose questions. The VVD, SGP, JA21 and Volt have asked some questions about the NATO 2% standard. I think it's a good thing to say that this cabinet has already made a strong contribution by putting 25% extra on the defense side. Structurally, EUR 3 billion will be added. We are going to take great steps to improve readiness, to improve employability and to increase combat power. Part of the money will go to operational support. It'll go to new capacity. It will go to people and also to means. I believe that the current war in Ukraine shows us that the threats are real and close. The security situation is deteriorating as a result. That is undoubtedly true. We are also faced with other diverse and complex threats, also elsewhere in the world, which sometimes have to do with Russia. It is clear to me that the situation has changed dramatically. That may mean that it must have financial consequences. I would be happy to map out for the Chamber exactly what that would mean. We must ensure that the armed forces are future-proof, even in the longer term. That means that we should want to take additional steps for that longer term to see how we can grow to that NATO standard. Again, my commitment to the Chamber is the following. I don't want to talk about amounts right now. I interpret the question in such a way that the Chamber would like to know exactly what we are talking about in the financial sense. I like to map that, also because there are still new figures coming around the CEP. Then it gets a little more precise than when I do that here off-the-cuff. I would like to say that it is not just about money. It's also about absorption capacity and spending money. It's also about rules. It's about procurement rules. It's about laws and regulations. It's about things that are different for the Defense Department, because there may be problems with the sound room during practice or because there may be problems with building and maintaining the nitrogen rules. That is something that has been highlighted in the coalition agreement. So that is not something new and that has not changed now, but it does say something about how quickly you are able to use the additional resources from the government agreement and any reinforcements of it.

So I think we need to be more creative to fill it out, if necessary with people other than our own soldiers or people who still need military training. That's the one. The second is this. That's very important. The Secretary of State for Defence has, of course, already begun to do so. That is to make the terms of employment more attractive, so that people are interested in joining the armed forces, and that you keep your people for the future. It's a big organization. It is still a labour-intensive organisation at the moment. We're gonna have to do smarter, too. Because we all know that the healthcare sector wants the same people, who we very much want to have in the armed forces, too. It is also very important that people work in education.

Secretary of State Van der Maat is working on that. That's part of the pay structure. Mr. Chairman. A question has just been asked in the interrupting debate. I can understand that, because I saw that coming up too. That was about people who would like to join the Ukrainian armed forces or people who say they would like to fight in Ukraine. To put it more generally: the fact that people in the Netherlands are so involved in what is happening in Ukraine and take all kinds of initiatives, for example to take people here or to make things go that way, are all beautiful and heart-warming initiatives. We must, of course, give them our wholehearted support. Because that actually shows that we sympathize and that the Netherlands is involved. I would also point out that Mr Hoekstra's portfolio is actually that the travel advice for Ukraine is red. This means that it is urgent advice not to travel to Ukraine. There are also a few rules. Humanitarian law of war says that only soldiers of the armed forces can participate directly in the fight. It is therefore not allowed for citizens to do so. In itself, employing a foreign military force is not, in principle, prohibited. That is only if you enlist in a war in which the Netherlands is also a party. Those are the actual circumstances. But I think it is important to emphasise this. We have laws and regulations for this. And again, it's just extremely dangerous. Mr. Chairman. I think I have answered the questions I have been asking.

116,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u4,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Two weeks of the terrible war in Ukraine is now taking place. Putin operates mercilessly and doesn't hesitate to do anything. He's even bombing a children's hospital. Nuclear power stations are also being shot at. It's dangerous. The number of victims and refugees is increasing rapidly. As a statement against the war, we organized a demonstration against the war on Saturday, including with the Party for the Animals. We had Ina from Ukraine and Svetlana from Russia on stage. They said, the harder Putin attacks, the stronger we hold each other. That was incredibly powerful and strengthens the fact that this is not a war of the Russian people, but of Putin. As always in a war, the elite will take care of his business. The people are allowed to bleed. All efforts must therefore be made to bring this madness to an end quickly. This afternoon there were negotiations in Turkey between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia. The media said there wasn't much coming out of it. My question is: are there any new conversations planned? Are there any leads pointing towards a cease-fire? What contribution can the international community, the United Nations, make to facilitate this process? I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. There are strong sanctions against the Russian elite, and that's good. Hopefully it increases the pressure on the Kremlin. At the same time, we see that those Russian oligarchs find shortcuts to escape those sanctions. See, for example, Nieuwsuur yesterday. The elite regulates a European passport for themselves and then escapes the measures. What is there to do about this? What about the Zuidas approach? As far as we're concerned, you're getting the green light to go hard on the Russian elite. Take their mailbox companies, but also their real estate and their yachts. Place refugees in their villas and transform the Zuidas into a social community. Our blessing has come to you. Mr. Chairman. Sanctions are good, but compliance is at least as important. We note that there is no capacity to comply with these sanctions. Can the government say a little more about that? Is it perhaps an idea to set up a special team that is now really going to focus on compliance with those sanctions, so that those oligarchs are really being dealt with? Mr. Chairman. Support for Ukraine is very important. We must be careful that our aid does not lead to escalation. A direct confrontation between NATO and Russia can be fatal. That is why we are not in favour of direct military interference, for example through a no-fly zone. Does the government share that opinion? Arms deliveries from the Netherlands will now be reported confidentially, says the Minister of Defence. That is worrying, because Parliament cannot talk about it. How can we monitor this, including an open debate? Mr. Chairman. Then about the consequences of the war for the Netherlands. We are seeing huge price increases, such as gas and oil. Low incomes in particular are the victims. That is why we say: compensate and abolish the energy tax. With regard to refugees, we see an enormous consensus. Eight out of ten Dutch people support a generous shelter; very good. It is probably going to take a long time, so it is important to ensure sustainable care, not only in the poor neighbourhoods, but also in the rich neighbourhoods.

117,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u6,"Mr. Chairman. It is a constant struggle between anger at seeing the terrible images, such as the destruction of a children's hospital, and the need to rationally weigh all options so that we do not contribute to further escalation. It is clear that the West stands as one block behind Ukraine. The financial and economic sanctions show that we strongly condemn the invasion. Ukraine is defending itself heroically against Russian aggression. The sending of extra military goods therefore has the support of my group. But what can we offer humanitarian aid to Ukrainians in besieged cities? The fact that Dutch people are very involved with the Ukrainian people is also reflected in the heartwarming initiatives to help refugees and in the Giro555 action. People are also concerned about the threats and consequences of this war. Russia is described as a gas station with nuclear weapons, manned by an unpredictable dictator in the Kremlin. How does the cabinet view the risks posed by the Russian use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons? And what about the safety of nuclear power plants in Ukraine? As far as the PvdA is concerned, it is important that we get off the Russian infusion as soon as possible. The option of a boycott is on the table for us. Can the Cabinet explain how discussions on this matter are taking place within the EU and how the possible consequences can be met? Putin will do everything in his power to convince Western societies that a harsh condemnation of the invasion is not worth the effort, that the costs are too high. It is therefore important for the government to act quickly to mitigate negative effects for those who are already struggling to make ends meet, with an emergency package for purchasing power and targeted compensation. Mr. Chairman. The Ukrainian President has made several requests to the West to establish a no-fly zone. According to the Labour Party, this could lead to an enormous escalation, but there is plenty of speculation about it. Can the Minister explain her considerations? Zelensky is asking for EU membership. Prime Minister Rutte seemed to want to go along with this earlier, but immediately came back to this. How could such a painful misunderstanding arise? And then delivering fighter planes. What is the state of play and what is the situation with regard to the humanitarian corridors? I'd like a response. It is also embarrassing that after all the big words, the British leave it to Ukrainian refugees to issue visas. Did the Prime Minister discuss this with Boris Johnson? Mr. Chairman. It gives a slight glimmer of hope that the Russians are now prepared to speak at political level with the Ukrainian Government, although the meeting this morning in Antalya did not produce anything. What possibilities does the Minister see for a follow-up? Is it true that Putin has abandoned his demand for a regime change in Kiev? Mr. Chairman. The war is painfully exposing the great intertwinedness with Russia, whether it concerns oil and gas or corrupt money flows. The years of dread must now make way for boldness. This includes solidarity, within the Netherlands, with those who feel the hardest of the consequences, but also at European level with those countries that are most vulnerable. Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, currently captures most refugees per capita. And then I haven't even talked about the geopolitical consequences this war could have for the country. Is the Cabinet prepared to provide bilateral financial support to the government in Chisinau? Mr. Chairman. Finally, I would like to say that it gives an uncomfortable feeling that the debate on our late former staff in Afghanistan has been postponed again, but hopefully we will be able to discuss this with the cabinet in the very near future.

125,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u35,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Many have already said it. It is really terrible that we have been seeing war crimes in Europe for two weeks in 2022. Attacks at children's hospitals, at nuclear power stations, but also at condominiums. We see armored cars and tanks crashing passenger cars. Horrible images. I was allowed to receive the calls from Giro 555 Monday night. Many older Dutch people who have active memories of the war, experience them all again. It is heartwarming to see that the Netherlands is united, generous in gifts, wants to receive refugees, but also that the West is united in harsh sanctions, unprecedentedly harsh sanctions. We welcome that. At the same time, we do not see enough movement in diplomatic efforts. Antalya today: failed. Also, the telephone call between Macron, Scholz and Putin seems to have yielded nothing. I would like to hear from the cabinet how it looks at the next diplomatic steps. I would also like to ask the question: if there is to be movement and perhaps there will be a good agreement on humanitarian corridors, which will be under surveillance, safe zones, then I think it would be a rather far-reaching step. Russia has indicated that it is leaving the Council of Europe. The OSCE is still a platform in which they are present and also the UN, but that too is becoming complicated. Are there any discussions or ideas on which third countries with capacity might be prepared to secure humanitarian corridors, not with military, but with observers? Are there any options for that? Diplomatic efforts are needed, but this naturally requires willingness on both sides. Putin must be prepared to do so under pressure. That is why sanctions are crucial. That was also discussed this morning in the debate on the Ecofin Council. The Minister for Finance has said that the Netherlands wants to go even further. It is very good that it is proactively working on a national legislative path to tackle the trust sector if it fails to reach agreement on this very quickly in Europe. My group is very pleased with that. At the same time, as the Netherlands, we can do a lot, because we have a great deal of responsibility. I hope that the cabinet gives that a great deal of priority. On the other hand, there are economic sanctions that the US and the United Kingdom have already called for when it comes to their own imports of fossil fuels from Russia. Now we understand very well that this cannot be done as a European Union. Energy dependence is too high, especially in those countries that are more in eastern Europe. But the Netherlands can and must do more in our view. We can, however, refrain from importing Russian gas and ensure that buyers of gas have the opportunity and have the responsibility to refrain from imports. Is the Cabinet prepared to take steps in that? Energy savings and renewable energy are all good steps. As far as we are concerned, they should have been put forward much earlier, but we do not need to talk about it now.

He had a plastic bag in his hand, a passport in his pocket, and a phone number was written on his hand. He managed to escape the war on his own, a war where Russia bombs maternity clinics, deliberately attacks refugees and commits war crimes. As Mr Van Mierlo once said: war is not one tragedy of millions, war is millions of times the drama of one. What is needed now is to oppose Russia, help Ukraine and achieve breakthroughs in the area of European cooperation. First of all, we must oppose Russia and get the Russian people on our side. Previous speakers have also said it. Diplomaticly, there is no progress, violence continues, while a broad ceasefire and a diplomatic solution is the only way out. I would like to ask the cabinet the fundamental question of whether we can at all assume that there are agreements to be made with Putin. Or did we pass that station? Last Monday, China called Russia its main strategic partner and seems to be acting as a silent accomplice to this violence. To what extent is China being forced to participate in the sanctions imposed? To what extent does the government see opportunities to pry China loose? I ask the latter because Russia, as well as China, openly speculates on whether or not existing biological weapons production sites on Ukrainian territory. To be quite honest, that sounds like a false context for the use of Russian biological or chemical weapons, and we must avoid that at all times. I would also ask for an assessment from the cabinet. I also ask how things are going with the approach of the Putin cabal. I'm asking how it goes with adding corruption to the Magnitsky Act. I'm asking how we're doing with setting up the sanctioning unit. I'm asking how it's going to be with the closing of mailbox companies on the Zuidas. I ask what additional sanctions we support. And I ask how we can support the Russian population abroad and the Russian free media. Following on, I would also like to ask about the security of the European continent. What can the Minister of Defence tell us about the security of the European continent and the strengthening of the eastern flank? How does it estimate Putin's nuclear escalation potential? And what precautions does the cabinet take? Mr. Chairman. Then there is the second point. That's supporting Ukraine. We must do everything we can to provide Ukraine with financial, military and humanitarian support. Previous speakers have also said that the humanitarian corridors are not only getting under way slowly, but that Russia is also cynically using them to directly attack refugees. The question therefore arises, very urgently and very urgently, how the European Union can contribute to the creation of places where refugees in Ukraine can be free. I'd like a response from the cabinet. I also agree with Mr Van der Lee who said that we should offer perspective to the Ukrainian people. That is the prospect of a free and democratic country. We certainly should not block Ukraine from becoming a candidate country of the European Union. At the same time, it is important that we stick to the Copenhagen criteria. That's what I'd like to say. This is not just the case with Ukraine. This applies to all candidate countries. Finally, Mr President. The Netherlands is next to Ukraine and we are willing to do a lot. Sanctions, even if they hurt ourselves. A safe house for a fleeing people, even though we have a housing shortage. More than 100 million to Giro555, even though some people have it pretty tight. We show that the Netherlands can do this. But I think it's asking for more. It calls for breakthroughs. I therefore ask the Minister of Defence whether the Strategic Compass should not be more ambitious. I ask what we are going to do to accelerate European cooperation there, especially in view of the fact that Russia is pressing us to the ground: we have until the next American elections. I ask for this energy dependency, which we have been advocating for more than ten years and which has sometimes even been laughed away in this house.

128,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u80,"Mr. Chairman. The war in Ukraine has been going on for two weeks. In those weeks, Russia has literally and figuratively crossed borders. Dozens of cities have been destroyed, hundreds of people have been killed and millions of civilians have fled. The damage is in billions. According to the SGP, the efforts should now focus on de-escalation. This will prevent an even greater humanitarian disaster and a global food crisis. In this way, it is possible to avoid the fire skipping to EU or NATO territory. For example, there are peace talks that really do justice to the Ukrainians. In that de-escalation, the ""how"" is of course the biggest challenge. As an aggressor, Putin is the first to stop the violence. The pressure on him should be as high as possible. I was thinking of the height of the Cold War: the Cuban crisis. Even then, in 1962, Moscow provoked another country with a hostile act. As we know, American President Kennedy showed determination and remained faithful to his own values and to his own security. He chose a proportional confrontation in the form of a sea blockade. It is our challenge to look for the modern-day variant. As far as the SGP is concerned, such a blockade must consist of joint, maximum and lasting financial, economic, diplomatic and defensive military pressure. Then Putin will benefit most from peace negotiations. My questions to the Foreign Minister are therefore the following. Does he agree that EU membership is neither necessary nor appropriate in this context? Is it true that sanctions are ineffective as long as only one Russian bank remains connected to SWIFT and if so, what do we do about it? What are the diplomatic efforts to secure a safe humanitarian corridor from the besieged cities towards the West and to prevent trafficking in human beings among Ukrainian refugees? Mr. Chairman. It has been said before: the war has awakened us from our military and geopolitical hibernation. This quote by Putin himself proves that a strong force is a bitter necessity. It dates back to his time at the KGB outpost in Dresden. ""Don't forget,"" said Putin, ""that only the obvious military superiority of the West can bring the rogue masters in the Kremlin back to their senses."" That military superiority was, and is, a long way to go in Europe for the time being, but it is now being worked hard. The SGP welcomes the motion on the NATO standard adopted last week, but we have been working on an initiative legislative proposal on this in recent months. Due to the Ukraine war, we are moving forward with speed. I would like to address all my fellow Members today: let us really take action now. Mr. Chairman. I will conclude with two points of interest. The first is this. What year should gas imports from Russia have stopped? Does the cabinet opt for larger gas stocks, long-term contracts and small-field extraction? The second point of attention: will there be a central support point for both Dutch people who receive Ukrainians and Ukrainians who have questions about visas and about access to the labour market? When is this to be clarified? Mr President, I will conclude. Yesterday many churches celebrated prayer for fishing, crop and labor. This prayer remains essential, including for peace in Ukraine, Europe and the rest of the world.

129,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u82,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ukrainian cities are being shot in ruins. This afternoon the news came that the tanks moving towards Kiev have already been spotted near the suburbs of Kiev. Millions of refugees are drifting and there is a dark cloud hanging over our economy. There are more and more attacks affecting the civilian population. That is extremely poignant. The PVV condemns this again. Can the Minister confirm the announcement that President Zelensky no longer wants to press for NATO membership of Ukraine and is also prepared to negotiate the status of the Donbas regions and of Crimea? Does the Minister agree with me that this opens up a diplomatic solution and should therefore be strongly supported by the international community? Has the government confirmed its support for this to Zelensky? Of course, we all want the violence to stop as soon as possible, but what does not help is Dutch and European politicians throwing extra oil on the fire. It is distasteful that some people smell an opportunity to push over the smoking Ukrainian ruins another agenda, namely for more European Union, for a Ukrainian NATO and EU membership, for a European army and for fighter jets for Ukraine. The PVV really thinks that this is totally irresponsible and dangerous. Just because Putin behaves recklessly doesn't mean that stupid behavior should be copied by us. By ""us,"" I mean the politicians from the Western countries. Where is the rest and the reason, then I wonder. Just pull a line on NATO membership and EU membership for Ukraine. Then it's clear. Then Mr. Zelensky also knows exactly where he's at those points. I'd like a reaction from the government. Mr. Chairman. The PVV has been warning against a war of sanctions for a long time. We're not gonna win anything, but we're gonna lose big. From Vladivostok to The Hague, ordinary citizens suffer from this. They are financially ruined, while Mr Putin does not care at all. However, the government wants to intensify that war of sanctions further. The Foreign Minister said, as I read, that all options for sanctions are on the table, including an import ban on Russian oil and gas. I would like to say to the cabinet: don't do that. I call on them not to. I would also like to ask whether it has been calculated what such a ban will cost the Dutch citizen extra. Then the military aspect of this war. Of course, we hope that the brave Ukrainians will hold on to this misunderstanding, even though it would only be to keep that grain barn out of Putin's hands. We must help the Eastern NATO allies who suffer from past trauma. They are our military allies. NATO would, of course, not be credible if we did not give these countries additional support. The PVV therefore looks positively at the measures to strengthen the eastern flank of the alliance. A Dutch Patriot air defense system is going to Slovakia. At least that's in preparation. The question then is whether our defense forces have enough air defense systems left to defend our own territory. What if we have to protect our own strategic interests, such as the port of Rotterdam, in further escalation of this whole situation? Can we still do that? I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. Finally, the PVV wishes to reiterate and emphasise the need to end Putin's aggression as soon as possible. We do not believe that this is possible by increasing economic and military pressure. Putin has nothing to lose and will, I fear, react with increasing violence. That would be terrible, and we really shouldn't have that.

130,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u114,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last Thursday I visited Ihor and his wife Marine in Rijswijk. They currently receive nine people, including three children, in a four-room flat. The commitment of people in the Netherlands is heartwarming. They send goods. They provide shelter for women. The amount of more than 100 million euros at Giro555 is also heartwarming. At the same time, practical questions now arise. What about teaching children who come? What's the status on medical care? This is settled for people in regular care, but how does it work for people who are taken care of by individuals? I know that the ministers have a different portfolio here, but these are the concerns that live there, and these are also the consequences of the Ukraine war, a war that the Netherlands is now also aware of. It is now two weeks since Russia started the war against Ukraine and the Russian President has turned shamelessly to the means of war. Thousands have now died compared to two weeks ago. For two weeks, a number of things have also been surprising, for example the gigantic Ukrainian force and the resistance of the population. That's also a surprise for Russia. What courage. What a power. We have also been surprised by the brave protests of thousands and thousands of Russians who have gone out at risk for their own lives or futures. There too we see courage, strength and a call for peace. Finally, the united response of the European countries to the imposition of sanctions. A front has been formed, a fist, which means that sanctions and measures are now in place. This offers some hope, but it raises the question of how to proceed. What steps should we take? As far as sanctions are concerned, I need an overview of what measures are actually in force and what sanctions are still in the toolbox. Could the Minister say something about that? Mr. Chairman. We do not hope so, but will, in the unexpected scenario that Russia wins the military battle, those sanctions be permanent? Will they be raised? I would like to hear what the longer-term vision of this scenario would be if this scenario were to become a reality. The Minister said in the Buitenhof programme that we must do everything we can to prevent a nuclear war. The Minister is cautious. I think that's wise, too. The Minister is opposed to setting up a no-fly zone, because NATO would then be directly involved in the conflict. The Christian Union agrees with that. If we do not want to escalate the conflict, then it is necessary and sensible to seize diplomacy and any chance of it. Does the Minister agree? What does he expect from the talks that have taken place in recent days and from the talks that have been in Turkey today? What is the Dutch cabinet's commitment? What does the Minister expect in the coming days? What role can the Netherlands play in NATO and the EU to maximise the chances of success in reaching an agreement? Mr. Chairman. The longer term will come to an end, because this war will also come to an end. Is it clear to the cabinet what Putin's final goal is? What is the ultimate goal of the Dutch cabinet with regard to our efforts in Ukraine? Is the government prepared to invite the countries representing the international legal order to discuss, for example, in The Hague, the city of law and peace, the longer-term vision and future of defence, and possibly also NATO and how we can continue to protect the international legal order in the future? Is the Minister prepared to take that down? Mr. Chairman. Then the questions to the Secretary of Defense. A number of Dutchmen have been deployed for four months in the framework of NATO Flash Forces, the NATO Response Force. That's good. Of course, that also brings with it concerns for the home front. But the question is also: what are the chances of this mission being extended? How many other missions can we expect in the short term? Mr. Chairman. It has just been mentioned, but discrimination at borders is unacceptable. That is where we expect an approach. But in the Netherlands we also see that Russians are being dishonored. We ask about this: what is the government's commitment? Mr President, I should like to leave it at that.

131,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u119,"Thank you, Mr President. We stood here a week and a half ago: the Prime Minister, Minister Ollongren and myself. A lot has happened since then. Maybe before I go into the questions, I can say a few things, including where we stand. Mr. Chairman. What we all see in the news I think that many of us are literally sleeping with it and getting up with it in the morning is that the military invasion continues. She's moving less quickly than Putin had thought, but she's going on and on and on. We all see the horrible images of devastated residential areas, of people who have died and of a population that, quite understandably, is on the run massively. One event is even more extreme than the other. It is always complicated to take one thing out of it, but I would like to join with those here who have referred to the attack on a children's hospital. I would have liked to have said that here too: what an absolute disgrace that is; what an absolute shame that such things happen. I am now getting ahead of what I am about to say about this, but the Netherlands too will do everything in its power to make those who contribute to it answer for it. Mr. Chairman. We also see a Ukrainian people who are still fighting manfully, and who are doing everything they can to defend their own country. We see a president and a government leading the people in battle. I find that very impressive. I have regular contact with my Ukrainian colleague myself. So does the Prime Minister. In addition, of course, we see the diplomatic trajectory. At least we are seeing some encouraging developments at the United Nations. There is a resolution that is widely supported: by no less than 141 countries that are all calling on Russia to stop violence. And there is a group of 35 countries that have at least not been on Russia's side. And about that 5... well, there's a lot to say about that, and I'm about to. Mr. Chairman. I was talking about accountability. For the cabinet, it is really clear that, through the evidence bank that we insist on, we will also bet on accountability in full width. We can do that through the UN and through the ICC, but we really want to do that, together with many like-minded people. Mr. Chairman. Then, of course, there is humanitarian aid. I'll tell you more about that in a minute. If that is all right, Mr President, I would like to remind you briefly of the fact that not only the cabinet, but very widely in society, is looking at what we can do with each other in this area. Honestly, I find that heart-warming in this valley of tears. I understand that many have been active themselves, even last Monday during the action of Giro555. I was traveling myself then, but I find it heartwarming to see how many Dutch people participate in that action, how broad and together they are moving in the Chamber and what Dutch people are willing to pull out of the closet. I refer to the collection of items and, in my opinion, Mr Ceder referred to the taking of people himself. The cabinet will continue to provide humanitarian support. We will continue with economic support. We will continue with the sanctions and we will continue with the arms supplies where they are appropriate and possible. We know ourselves in very, very good company. Mr. Chairman. I'm about to start with block one, diplomacy. Then there are two, sanctions, and three, the military-political and nuclear. In addition, I'm going to talk about the non-military nuclear. Fourthly, I do it humanitarianly, and fifthly, I still have a richly damaged category of others. The Minister for Defence, of course, deals with all the aspects that really have to do with the military. That's a lot, too. Mr. Chairman. I'll start with the international diplomatic. I will also say a few things about accountability. The question asked by Mr Eppink, Mrs Piri and Mr Van Dijk is: what is the status of the peace talks and how does the Netherlands view them? I would like to start by repeating what I have said before. On the one hand, I think it is absolutely right that we should support Ukraine as much as possible, that we should focus on sanctions, arms supplies and everything that goes with strong disapproval and that we should give our hands and feet to that disapproval. At the same time, we know that every conflict that the world has ever seen ends up in a cease-fire in all kinds of different forms. So you should also use that diplomatic channel, especially when you see how terrible the consequences are for the civilian population. So that's what the Netherlands is committed to. That is what the whole European community is committed to. I would like to say that the whole Western community is committed to this. But there is one thing I would like to say. I believe that we should support Ukraine in order to prevent them from being blackmailed to the negotiating table at any time. So conversations are good, but under conditions that can also be borne by Ukraine. The expectations of today's talks were low. Mrs Piri and, in my view, Mr Van Dijk asked for that. At least that part came true. I've been in touch with my colleague through the app for a short time. That doesn't all lend itself to sharing here. But my observation is that Ukraine wants to take advantage of this every time that there is a real opportunity, and that it wants to see whether talks, talks and negotiations can bring an end to the conflict. Again, but also on their terms. Mr Eppink asked whether there was any real prospect of an agreement. There isn't. There have been several calls. So far, expectations have been always low and, unfortunately, the conversations have been very low. Given how the cards are, I have no choice but to look at the Russians again. Because they're in a place where they don't have to be at all. They make all kinds of demands there that are in no way reasonable. I think it is good that Ukraine continues to go there. I hope that's what they're going to do. But when we reach acceptable agreements there, it is very difficult to say. That will also be seen in the light of what happens naturally on the ground. Mrs Piri asked whether it was true that Mr Putin had abandoned the demand for regime change. To be honest, that's hard to describe. You'll receive several messages via international media. Sometimes something is also read in which in this case a Kremlin spokesperson suddenly no longer uses terminology. Then you wonder, is that off the table? The honest answer is, of course, that we do not know. Moreover, we know from the past six months that Putin is not too bad to say a and then do b. He has also said several times that he was not after a military conflict, without further specifying what those 170,000 troops were doing there. Of course, that's where he totally cheated. Mr. Chairman. Mr Sjoerdsma asked about a topic that he and Mrs Mulder also asked about last time: the European Security Council. If this crisis shows anything, then it is that the European partners must be able to make a fist together. You can increasingly see that we in Europe are on two feet: on the NATO leg and on the EU leg. NATO is, of course, really about the military. But to an increasing extent, at least with regard to these sanctions, the EU has so far managed very well to stand together on that geopolitical leg, although that leg is still a bit uncomfortable and much remains to be done in this area. Mr Sjoerdsma knows my commitment to such a European Security Council. But I have also pointed out before that it is not the case that all 27 Member States are cheering behind me when I put that idea back on the table. I also agree with Mr Sjoerdsma, who said that a diplomatic solution is ultimately the only way out. He also asked: are appointments with Putin possible? That is a very fair question. We don't know. We really have to wait and see. Mr. Chairman. Mr Sjoerdsma and others referred to China. They asked how China behaves in the conflict: to what extent does China reject the conflict, or indeed not? Let's be honest. I find it uncomfortable at all that there is a group of 35 countries, who have said that they remain on the fence and do not recognize colour. As far as I am talking to these countries, I am, of course, trying to speak to some of them, either personally or officially, I am saying that this is about more than Ukraine. This is, of course, primarily about Ukraine, but also about how the world community treats each other, what standards you find acceptable and unacceptable. In this type of conversation, I often ask how countries look at sovereignty and respect each other's borders. Most countries generally agree on this. Mr. Chairman. Maybe I can add something. On the one hand, the mission is that we should be responsible for the Netherlands in particular, but together with the allies, we should ensure that we guard the soft underbelly of those 141 countries and seek very active diplomatic contact with that 141 group. Why? Because it may be tempting for some of those countries to leave that group again in the future. Not everyone is as tight as the Canadians, the Americans, the British and us. On the other hand, we need to see if we can't actively approach and edit that group of 35 countries, in order to convince them of a different position. Then you've got five left. In the short term, I do not have the illusion that I can move them to a different position, because we all know which group of countries is in it. But there is a great deal of work in the area of 141 and 35 countries. And that would be the last piece of my reply towards Mr Sjoerdsma, which also goes in the direction of China, because I find it uncomfortable that one does not speak much more explicitly. Mr. Chairman. Then Mr. Van der Lee asked...",True,0.07,0.811,0.119,0.9984,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 59, Session 12 (2022-03-10)",2022-03-10,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 12,Meeting 59,Sitting 2022-03-10,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,WopkeHoekstra,"Hoekstra, Wopke",M,1975,47.0,False,3

China also claims to consider certain issues to be important, namely sovereignty, territorial integrity and no interference in internal affairs. This is often the Chinese repertoire that we hear when we discuss matters within China. We have to report that if you think that's what you're doing, you'll find some of this. So that's one of the things we have to try. The extent to which there is a Chinese-Russian axis in the longer term is difficult to provide. It is certainly true that they share certain interests and perspectives. One of these is fundamental criticism of the post-war world order, which we are very much in favour of. Both countries are strongly critical of liberal democracy, of the type of human rights policy we advocate and of the international institutions, which, on the contrary, we attach great importance to. In those respects, they are united. They are also united in many respects in their aversion to the United States and to a lesser extent to Europe. At the same time, they are not automatically partners in everything. They have also had their conflicts in the past. They are also of different sizes. Russia is, of course, the world's second most powerful country in the military field.

133,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u221,"I'll see if I can put a date on that in second term. Mr President, the third block. That was about the political-military, as far as I'm concerned. I'll add the nuclear power plants to that. It started with a question that was still about the no-fly zones. I would like to repeat what I said earlier. It is very difficult at all to say ""no"" to someone who is in a death struggle, to say to someone like that that we cannot deliver something. At the same time, I think it is sensible that Stoltenberg indicated that NATO should not do so, in order to prevent you from ending up in a direct conflict between NATO and the Russian Federation, with all its repercussions and consequences. So that's really not wise. Mr Van Dijk also asked about our opinion on the no-fly zone. It's not suddenly on the agenda. So that's basically what stayed the same as last week. This also fits perfectly into the story: de-escalating where possible. That's what I just called it. Mr Brekelmans, Mr Kuzu and Mrs Piri asked about the war aircraft exchange. In addition, we simply see what the MPs see: they are talking about this. It seems that there is no question of delivery at the moment. At the same time, when you read the American media about it, you get the idea that it might still be discussed. So I find it very difficult to talk about what these two countries are trying to do bilaterally. What I consider to be very important also affects the Dutch responsibility: we do not have an assessment of what Member States are doing one-on-one. If NATO were to do anything, NATO would supply fighters, then you will really be in completely different waters.

I'm a little worried about that, because these Russian students here are studying in a democracy and are going back to Russia. We also need those students for exchange. There they can teach other students something about democracy. I would like to keep those students, as well as the Belarusian students, for the Netherlands. I'm sorry that this question is so out of the blue, but I was wondering if we could make sure that these students could just keep going to school here.

135,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-10-tweedekamer-12.u271,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The battle in Ukraine is hardened. The stories we hear from the war zone really go through marrow and bone. I can only express my disgust at the horrible images we see from Marioepol. Putin's attack is incredibly brutal. People are forced to leave home and fireplace, if that's still there. More than 2 million people are on the run. Many have said this evening that it is heartwarming to see how the Netherlands sympathises and shows solidarity. We saw it in the action of Giro555. We also see it in all kinds of initiatives that people take. The war is affecting all of us. It also has a major impact on our military and on their families. I visited Romania early this week. There's a company of 11 Air Mobile Brigade, participating in an exercise, along with our allies there. They feel that proximity. The same applies to the people who sailed last Sunday to be part of the Standing NATO Maritime Group 1. This concerns Rotterdam and the Seven Provinces. They too know that they are going somewhere where they can be called up by NATO if necessary. And the people on the quay feel that, too. So it's different for them. That's because of the terrible war. Mr. Chairman. First of all, I wanted to say something about how we look at the situation in Ukraine and answer a few questions about it. Then I come to a few comments on defence expenditure and the questions that have been asked about it. Then NATO. Then there is the support we give to Ukraine. Then there are questions about the EU. I think I've had everything I need. Much will, of course, be in line with the questions that Mr Hoekstra has just answered. The situation is, of course, evolving. You all read in the media that Kiev is still under Ukraine's control. After the initial surprise effect, the pace of the Russian fundamental offensive has declined significantly in the beginning. In any case, the courageous and persistent action of Ukrainian military forces has the effect that the Russian advance to Kiev seems to be much slower than planned and expected, with only sporadic terrain gains and an almost stable front line. Nevertheless, the attempt is, of course, clear. Putin is slowly but surely trying to include Kiev with the Russian troops, with the ultimate goal of conquering that city and occupying the government center. There are mainly several other Ukrainian cities surrounded, among others Marioepol of which we have seen these images. So there are often very heavy fights taking place in and around those cities. They also use heavy weapons. You'd expect this image to go on like this in the next few days, and possibly get worse. A number of members today asked about the potential risks of using chemical and biological weapons. We've already seen the cluster bombs. Mr Hoekstra has just answered the questions. We know the Russian army has those thermobaric weapons. We also know that Russia does not hesitate to deploy chemical weapons. In other words, we certainly cannot exclude that commitment. It has not yet been said that it is going to happen. I don't want to speculate on that either. Of course, that doesn't help the situation. But we have heard today from the British and American allies that they actually have a bit of the same assessment: the use of chemical weapons fits in with that schematic that is sometimes applied, even with a false flag first and then bet. Then there are the questions about the nuclear military part. Mr Sjoerdsma, Mrs Mulder and Mr Dassen asked for this. That nuclear threat was simply expressed by Putin, by Russian leadership. That's rhetoric, nuclear rhetoric, but nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and objectionable. I think it's very important that we don't go along with that. The cabinet has always said that. We always take all the scenarios into account. It is actually NATO's core business to do so, but nuclear escalation is not the issue. The commitment of the Netherlands is to prevent escalation and further escalation, which is in line with Minister Hoekstra. In the Netherlands, we have a decision-making structure and crisis plans for this. Several departments are involved in this. But again, it's not something we're preparing for right now. Mr. Chairman. Then there are the comments that have been made on defence expenditure. We talked about this last week, of course, in the debate. The cabinet has already taken significant steps, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine simply means a change in the security situation. This has dramatically deteriorated. We have to bear in mind that this can continue for a long time to come. There are consequences. This has consequences for the Netherlands. So it can't be without consequences for the defence budget. We discussed that at the time. We have seen the historic step taken by the Germans. That really is a huge investment in the German armed forces. We can see that in more countries. We have also seen it with the Danes and with the Swedes. There is therefore a clear mandate for the cabinet, namely that we must speed up the strengthening of our armed forces. We must invest in cooperation with allies: European allies and allies in NATO. We need to map out what more is needed. The current situation not only shows the importance of it, but also gives it even more urgency. The Chamber has also expressed this in the Sjoerdsma motion. As far as I am concerned, the starting point is: what do we think our armed forces should be able to do? What do we want to achieve together with our allies? I've already agreed to give the Chamber an insight into this. We're working on the short term. We'll see what we can do to raise the readiness faster. We must, of course, also ensure that we get a good idea of this on the defence side, so that we can decide on it within the cabinet. We must be ambitious, but also realistic about what we can achieve quickly. We have to ask ourselves how we can plan in a realistic way so that we can best shape spending. In other words, we really need to make sure, in the coming period, that we can also make good and efficient investments in the long term in order to ensure that the armed forces are future-proof. This also includes a good mapping of how we can work more closely with our European partners. So we need to look at how we can do better and how we can strengthen each other within the organisations we are in, NATO and the EU, and with our national partners. I think that is an answer to Mrs Van der Plas' question, namely: what are we doing with the Sjoerdsma motion? Mr. Chairman. There were a number of questions about NATO. Firstly, there was a question from Mr Sjoerdsma. But Mr De Roon and Mrs Mulder also asked: what about our collective defence? This is, of course, one of the main tasks of the Dutch armed forces and the task of NATO. We have, of course, already taken steps as NATO. The Netherlands also participated in this. The reinforced air-policing, the increased readiness of the reaction force and the strengthening of NATO units on the east flank are all rapid reinforcements designed to strengthen and improve NATO's tasks of deterrent and defence. The use of fighter aircraft for air-policing over Eastern Europe has been extended until the end of the month. I would like to clarify one point. In the second half of this month we will only contribute to this with F-16's, so no longer with the F-35's. They are going to contribute to air-policing in Bulgaria, as already announced. But that happens in April, May. We are preparing with Germany the deployment of a Patriot air defense unit in Slovakia. This concerns about 150 Dutch soldiers. The Chamber has also been informed about this. The final decision will fall after Slovakia has also given the green light. That's all being prepared now. We are indeed investigating, together with the French and the Belgians, but at the request of NATO and the French, a possible military contribution from the Netherlands to a Battlegroup in Romania. Of course, we have to look at what we can and what the impact is on our armed forces. Next week we have a meeting of NATO Defence Ministers. Further plans for this reinforcement are being worked out within NATO. We will, of course, always have to look at how the Netherlands can contribute to this. But these are the main directions. We're going to build on that, of course. Mr De Roon said that he is concerned about the defence of our own territory if we make a great deal of effort on the eastern flank of Europe. I think it is best to defend the Netherlands by defending Europe's eastern flank. Because the NATO border is there and the threat is there too. So everything we can do there to discourage and defend is the defence of the Netherlands.

The idea is not that 30 countries have everything to defend 30 individual countries with all the stuff. That's how it works. That goes for us, too. We too must make choices. Then I will go to Mrs Mulder, because she had another question about the Baltic States, about the commitment there and how it is coordinated. It is really coordinated by NATO. We've been there for five years. We just stopped to think about the anniversary. The NATO Forward Presence units are now under direct command of the SACEUR. That's special. That's because of the threat we're facing right now. This means that it is fully coordinated by NATO, of course in close consultation with the lead nations and the other participating countries. This means that everything that is happening in the Baltic States is in line with what NATO believes should be done there. So we don't do that bilaterally or in any other way anymore. No other current requests were made to the Netherlands from the Balticum either. Mr Ceder talked about whether the stakes could be extended. Let me see if I am referring specifically to the stakes he meant, because for the flash power only a French unit has now been deployed. The Netherlands is not yet a part of that. We are active in air policing with the F-16s and F-35s, but they are not part of the NATO Response Force. I just mentioned the Patriots. I have already mentioned Romania. Of course, we still have the Navy, which is active in the Standing NATO Maritime Group. Maybe he was referring to the latter, because he mentioned the four-and-a-half month term. In everything a time limit is set for the bet and there is a rotation. That was agreed in advance. There is therefore no reason to assume that the crew of the Seven Provinces......... will be active longer than four and a half months..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Indeed, I had already stated that we are reluctant to communicate on the provision of military support after the very first decision on this matter. That is because we have come at a different stage, actually since the moment it was clear that the war would continue. That is also true for reasons of operational security.

Then there are a number of comments on the EU. The Court is aware of the fact that the EU has adopted two aid measures. The European Peace Facility has earmarked 500 million for the supply of military goods. That's what's happening now. The Foreign Minister has already said a few things about sanctions. European defence cooperation is of great importance. It is a subject of discussion in Europe and now in Versailles. Mr Sjoerdsma specifically asked about the Strategic Compass. It was indeed agreed to conclude the Strategic Compass and now adopt it in the next formal European Council in March. But, indeed, we must take a very close look at whether this has been adequately given to the return of war in Europe. I think everyone thought so. We have seen that the new draft has made considerable adjustments, so that it is in fact better suited to the situation we are now in. The threat posed by Russia has therefore been taken up more prominently. The Strategic Compass also addresses the need for Member States to increase defence expenditure. It is also about additional support for Ukraine. This concerns, among other things, the peace facility that I was just talking about. It is about how important cooperation between NATO and the EU is and how important the unity of the two organisations is. The compass is also becoming more ambitious in terms of military mobility, a subject that the Netherlands has always considered important. In other words: I think it is good to make sure that the Strategic Compass is there, because only then can you actually implement the objectives of the Strategic Compass. I hope, therefore, that the compass can be adopted in this adapted form.

You can only maintain such a zone if fighters, jet fighters, NATO are not only going to fly there but are also taking action when a no-fly zone is being violated by the Russian military.

I mentioned the European Peace Facility. It is true that there is a slight form of coordination under this heading, but it remains, of course, that it concerns bilateral requests to individual countries, i.e. to Member States of the European Union or NATO allies. It's a bilateral matter. There is, of course, mutual contact with important countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. I would like to say a few words about three motions. First of all, the motion in part No. 31. That is the motion tabled by Mr De Roon and Mr Van Haga in connection with the debate on aircraft defence. There is one point I would like to make of a misunderstanding. It is not the case that the Netherlands brings a full Patriot unit to Slovakia. We have been asked to contribute to that of the Germans. I need to be specific. As far as the motion is concerned, my point is that we are members of an alliance. That's what's for the collective defense of our territory. An attack on one is an attack on all. It is precisely through this cooperation that we protect the Netherlands. If the Chamber wants to know exactly what is being used, what is available in the Netherlands and whether it is about the whole air force or the whole military force, the Chamber will always be informed about it. I will never deny the Chamber any information, but the Cabinet does not agree with the position below. That's why I'm dissuading the motion. Then the motion to part No. 35, on the European army. Of course, it has been pointed out very often. It has also been said very often by the cabinet: there is no European army in existence, no more than there is a NATO army. The Strategic Compass doesn't mention that at all. We have a single set of forces. We'll put the units where they're needed. That could be in the UN context. That could be NATO.

146,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u2,"Mr. Chairman. Romanchenko was 96 years old, survived four concentration camps and died when a Russian rocket landed on his house. That's week four of Putin's ""denazification"" invasion. In Marioepol, a city larger than Utrecht, the whole city is leveled. Russian-speaking residents are trapped like rats. [[Sentence could not be parsed: Ze moeten straathonden doden voor eten en dat is week vier van Poetin die opkomt voor Russischsprekenden.]] The extreme violence is also an expression of frustration, because military Russia seems to be making virtually no progress anymore. It suffers great losses. That is also my first question to the Prime Minister: how does he indicate the current military situation in Ukraine? Mr. Chairman. This Russian aggression and war crimes must be stopped. D66 therefore believes that we should continue to supply weapons, as well as more powerful anti-aircraft weapons, such as the S-300 systems that NATO fellow members have Slovakia and Turkey. This could enable Ukraine itself to ensure that Russia no longer has access to Ukraine's airspace with aircraft and helicopters. This allows Ukraine to de facto set up a no-fly zone itself. I ask the Prime Minister whether this is on the table at the NATO summit and whether the Netherlands would support it. Mr. Chairman. Humanitarian aid must also be provided. As far as I am concerned, this is where the absence of the UN stands. Of course, the Security Council has been blocked, and that is primarily due to Russia and to some extent China. But what is preventing the Secretary-General of the United Nations from taking on a role of his own, from fulfilling his own role, from calling not only for diplomacy, but also for humanitarian access, for aid, to address Russia, for example, in the VR resolution of 2018? The Netherlands has been a cosponsor of this and Russia itself has also designated starvation as a war crime. I would like a response from the Prime Minister: how does he see the role of the UN? Mr. Chairman. We also need to work on sanctions, not only for more sanctions but also for smarter sanctions. We have rightly taken very far-reaching measures in these first weeks of the conflict, but we must now include them in a political strategy. That's what my questions to the Prime Minister are about. On the one hand, what sanctions does the Netherlands want, or does Prime Minister Putin want, in the event of further violence and further war crimes against civilians? Is he thinking about an oil boycott? Is he thinking about a port boycott? On the other hand, what exactly does Putin have to do to get sanction relief? Is that a cease-fire? Is that a peace agreement? Is that complete withdrawal? Or, for example, are these the demands that we, as Western countries, have, in other words, the withdrawal of Russia's occupying forces, not only from Ukraine but also from other states, such as Moldova and Georgia, the cessation of violence on the European continent and not the use of chemical weapons? Madam President. Finally, in this block, how do we relate to Putin? It is always dangerous to look hypothetically and too far ahead, but suppose Ukraine comes to a comparison with Russia, partly voluntarily and perhaps partly forced. We don't know, but if that happens, is that enough to get those sanctions off the table? My group does not think so. We think it is dangerous to see the future in a normal way with Putin, but we also see that European unity is the most important thing. So I also ask the Prime Minister about the tension we are seeing here. Mr. Chairman. How do we separate China from Russia, given the EU-China summit that is coming? What means will the European Union use to achieve this? I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. The existing sanctions should work better. The cabinet has now frozen EUR 400 million in funds. That is good and good, but as far as my group is concerned, we need more coordination, more transparency and also a change in the sanction law. As far as coordination is concerned, first of all, the personal sanctions of the European Union and the United States are not sufficiently harmonised. For example, the European Union has sanctioned Abramovich, but the United States has not. And with the United States, there is an oligarch on the list that owns houses in Finland, but not in the European Union. This is how holes are created, allowing these people to escape the dance. Here's what I'm asking the Prime Minister. How is the cabinet going to improve coordination between the different institutions? Can the Prime Minister ensure that packages are better aligned between the European Union and the United States, so that these holes for oligarchs disappear? Is Turkey the prime minister just visited Turkey and Erdogan also asked to join the sanctions? And who is actually responsible within the European Union for effectively enforcing these sanctions? Mr. Chairman. Then there's the law amendment I was talking about. The cabinet also mentions in several letters that only financial institutions and trust offices are obliged to report their relationships with sanctioned persons. Companies or entities with sanctioned owners that have assets as assets on the balance sheet are excluded from their scope. And capital in the form of real estate, yachts, shares or other assets literally slips through the loopholes of the law. I call on the Cabinet to amend the law on this point and to consider adding supervision and a hotline for companies and entities. I'd like a response. Finally, I see Mr Van der Lee standing on this point, Mr President. Putin has just announced that gas payments should be made in roubles. If that call is heeded, it will undoubtedly lead to the currency becoming more worthy of the rouble and the effects of sanctions being reduced. I'd like a response from the Prime Minister.",True,0.087,0.791,0.123,0.9902,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 63, Session 8 (2022-03-23)",2022-03-23,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 8,Meeting 63,Sitting 2022-03-23,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,SjoerdSjoerdsma,"Sjoerdsma, Sjoerd",M,1981,41.0,False,3
147,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u7,"Mr. Chairman. Then the NATO summit, the Strategic Compass, the protection of our territory. The Strategic Compass has rightly been adopted. Steps are being taken regarding military headquarters, an intervention force, joint procurement and training missions. But the question is, of course, whether that is sufficient in the longer term. Now we can boast of a huge, strong NATO presence in the east and count on a president in the United States, Biden, who appreciates the transatlantic bond and is willing to make sacrifices for it. But the question is whether this is still the case in 2024, in the next US presidential election. So, looking at European defence capabilities, our hard power, is also the question of whether we are sufficiently equipped for a scenario in which we are still dealing with an aggressive Russia but a less cooperative United States in 2024. That brings me to the question to the Prime Minister about what steps in the European defence field he thinks we should take in view of that scenario, that doom scenario, in order to ensure that we can protect our own territory. What will be the focus of this NATO summit? And is there any news about the execution of my motion on defence money, which has been widely supported by the Chamber? Mr. Chairman. The leap that we must take in the defence field must also be made elsewhere, namely in the area of asylum and in the area of foreign affairs. First, asylum. First of all, I would like to congratulate Poland, which is now receiving almost 2 million refugees. You can only take a deep bow to the efforts of society there. They rightly need to be compensated financially for this. That's what the Prime Minister says. But I ask him to guarantee three things. One. No funds to Poland that Poland is not entitled to because of violations of the rule of law. Two. I believe that funding for the reception of refugees should also mean that we see a breakthrough in the European Asylum and Migration Pact. Of course, the Eastern European Member States in particular have been blocking the past. Three. So let us organise the financial support so that the money is used for refugee shelter rather than for the election campaign of the PiS party. Mr. Chairman. The third leap we have to make is in the field of foreign policy. Where we have seen enormous consensus in Europe over the last few weeks, we now see Orbán threatening again with vetos. I would like to hear from the Prime Minister how he continues to work and work towards a majority decision to abolish the veto. Because if there's a time to move forward, it's now.

And is good decision-making guaranteed here too? Finally, on the refugees. We had a good debate this morning with the Secretary of State.

A war in which a country invades a neighbouring country with violence for no reason at all. We are now in the fourth week of that war. The situation is getting worse every day in cities like Marioepol, with as one of so many lows the bombing of the theatre with civilians and children. The resistance and fighting skills of the Ukrainians deserve our great respect. It is impressive to see how the Ukrainians fight for their freedom and their country. Last week, albeit digitally, I took part in the Council of Europe. That's where Ukrainians told themselves what they were going through. Politicians who travelled freely and safely to discussions with other parliamentarians a month ago now had to do their story from a bunker. It is therefore entirely right that the Russian politicians who do this to them should be excluded from that council. That is a historic but inevitable decision, and as far as I am concerned, it is right. Mr. Chairman. Let us hope that the pressure of the international community on Russia and Putin, combined with that determination and resilience of the Ukrainians, will ensure that Russia stops its aggression quickly. It is therefore a good thing that both parties are still on the table together, no matter how difficult that may be, especially for Ukraine. That must be unreal: while your country is under attack, you must sit down with that same party and listen to their demands. Mr. Chairman. I would also like to express my appreciation from this place for all the Dutch who are contributing to helping the Ukrainians, whether it is about donating money, collecting clothes or taking a refugee into their homes. It is heartwarming to see all these initiatives, and it is good that the cabinet is also committed to good care and that Ukrainians who want to do so could get to work right away. While I am working on compliments: also a compliment to the cabinet, but certainly also to the officials and to the Dutch military, who are undoubtedly working day and night. They are taking everything out of the closet right now to increase pressure on Russia, help Ukraine and keep the Netherlands and our NATO allies safe. Mr. Chairman. It is important to maximise the pressure on Russia and Putin. We really need to do everything we can to stop the war and the violence. The VVD has therefore repeatedly argued for a sanctions package to be as robust as possible. I read in the annotated agenda that there are no new sanctions on the table during the Council. But does that also mean that there is no longer any talk, for example, of banning Russian ships in European ports or of an oil boycott? The VVD agrees with the cabinet that we need to keep an eye on security of supply and that rising global oil prices can also play into Russia's hands. But would a construction like the US used in Iran in 2012 be an option, for example? So I am referring to a reduction of imports and the placing of funds on, for example, a third party account. This will at least prevent Russia from using the funds to finance the war. Mr. Chairman. Enforcement is crucial for the effective functioning of sanctions. That is why I ask the Prime Minister what scope he still sees in making better use of the existing instruments. Colleagues have already referred to this. For my group, the 400 million in funds that we have now frozen, is a little thin on the billions that seem to be flowing in or through the Netherlands. How does the Prime Minister view that? This afternoon, we read that Putin intends to pay countries for Russian gas with rubles in order to stop the price drop. Can the Prime Minister confirm that we are not cooperating in this and that, if necessary, the banking sanctions will be extended? Another condition for effective outcome of sanctions is that as many countries as possible join. What opportunities does the Prime Minister see for further countries to do so? In particular, I would like to draw attention to Serbia's attitude. That is a candidate country with which we have recently taken additional steps. But Serbia seems to have two faces in this area. On the one hand, it is really hopeful and hopeful that they have recently voted in favour of a resolution like this for the first time in the UN, but I also note that the country is not yet participating in the EU sanctions. How does the Prime Minister weigh that, especially in view of the new requirements in the accession framework? Does that perhaps give us cause to look again critically at the recent additional steps taken? Mr. Chairman. The situation in Ukraine has reaffirmed the importance of a united and decisive EU, as well as the importance of increasing our strategic autonomy in areas such as energy and food security. It is also good that the EU has maintained that unity and remains united. It's been different. In my group's view, developments in Ukraine underline once again the need for European countries to invest in strong defence. Better cooperation is crucial here, but the crisis also makes it clear to us that NATO is really the cornerstone of our collective security. The EU should facilitate this as far as possible, for example by speeding up cooperation through military mobility wherever possible and facilitating the joint development of weapons systems. In this respect, the Strategic Compass adopted by the Council is a good basis for this. I am also pleased that it has taken the starting point for European defence capabilities to be complementary to NATO. In this sense, it is also appropriate that the NATO Summit and the EU Summit should be mutually exclusive this time. What does the Prime Minister expect from the NATO summit? Are additional troops being sent to the eastern border, for example? I would also like to continue to emphasise the importance of maintaining the supply of arms to Ukraine. Can the Prime Minister assure us that this will continue to be the case? Another issue that we cannot ignore in this context is energy security and reducing the dependence of a country such as Russia. I referred to that earlier. It is good that the Commission has come up with the RePowerEU plan, but we hear differences of opinion between Member States. Can the Prime Minister say a little more about the EU's force field on this point? In the annotated agenda, the VVD reads the cabinet commitment. She'll be able to follow them in her own right. But the VVD does not read about the funding of this plan, while rumours about a new fund à la RRF are getting louder. Can the Prime Minister comment on the Commission's commitment? Is it true that a number of Member States will come forward with a proposal for such a fund during the Council? Does the Prime Minister then agree with the VVD that, for possible funding, we should look at already available resources and instruments? I assume that this will be the line of the cabinet, but I would also like to recall Mr Omtzigt's recently adopted motion. Although priority number one must, of course, be to stop military violence as quickly as possible, safe humanitarian corridors are vital until then. It is essential that we continue to insist on this as an EU and as an international community. Does the Prime Minister share that opinion? What is the EU's commitment to this?

156,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u62,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. They are images that will never get used to: Ukrainians trying to flee the war massively. The image of a woman and her two children killed by Russian mortar bombs. They lie motionless on the ground, covered in sheets. Next to them, the suitcases are still standing up. Or the images of the destruction of a children's hospital and the child's bodies which are then quickly buried in a narrow ditch, in the frozen earth of Marioepol. They're heartbreaking scenes. They're going through marrow and bone. A few people dare call Russian intervention in Ukraine extremely mild. I call it barbaric and a dirty war against the Ukrainian people. Putin does not shy away from any means in this war. The end justifies the means. Millions of Ukrainians are on the run and a multiple is stuck in cities. They can't go anywhere. Putin is deliberately preventing people from getting food to force the government to its knees. Hunger is used as a weapon of war. Meanwhile, the hospitals are being bombed. Meanwhile we see the first images of mass graves entering. Mr. Chairman. I think that the United Nations is too quiet about the war in Ukraine. The UN must play a more active role. The organisation was set up to prevent or mitigate such human suffering. The UN cannot be completely paralysed by the Russians' veto. In this context, I ask the Cabinet to what extent it is possible for the United Nations and the Red Cross to have a great deal of involvement in the conflict. Can the U.N. Cabinet plead for humanitarian corridors or air bridges to drop food and medicine? I'd like a response. Mr. Chairman. Then there is the European summit. I welcome the strength and speed with which the EU Member States have jointly responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin thought he was divisive, but he has reaped unprecedented European unity. First of all, I would like to pay tribute to the Prime Ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, Mr Morawicki, Mr Janša and Mr Fiala. Last week they paid Zelensky a visit. What a brave journey, certainly not without risk. Mr. Chairman. The European commitment should aim to achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, followed by a controlled withdrawal from Ukraine. I look forward to the strategy to achieve these goals. We have imposed large-scale sanctions on Russia in recent weeks. That is good, but we should not only use these sanctions as a means of punishment. We need to clarify our objectives and adjust policies accordingly. If our goal is peace in Ukraine, the right message must be sent to Moscow, however unsatisfactory it may seem. That message is that an agreement that Kiev accepts will give some relief to sanctions. I'd like a response. Next: what sanctions do we have left behind and how much economic power do we have towards Russia if they are to deploy biological weapons? Mr. Chairman. At present, all efforts must be made to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible. But we also need to look forward. On the first day that Russian weapons remain silent, the European Union must be ready to help Ukraine in any way possible. The German Finance Minister wants a marshall plan for Ukraine to help the country with the consequences of the Russian invasion. As far as the CDA is concerned, we are starting to look for strength for this plan today and now. We therefore ask the Cabinet to take a leading role here within the EU and its allies. This plan must be aimed at recovery and reconstruction. For example, it could consist of development aid, grants and loans, but certainly also of knowledge and skills to help build infrastructure, health care and industry and to help society and the economy get back on top. Putin must already be clear that the EU and its allies will not abandon Ukraine and will continue to stand side by side with the Ukrainian people even after the end of the war. A clear signal. There are a number of specific points, Mr President. Can the Prime Minister address the peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia? How serious do we have to take these conversations? On the accompanying policy: what are we doing for the very heavily affected Dutch sectors, especially those that are capital intensive? What choice do they have? What else do they like? Can the Minister reflect on this? Mr. Chairman. It is also good that we are taking action to reduce our energy dependence on Russia. What is the European force field in this? And what is expected of each Member State to absorb this energy decommissioning? Unfortunately, there are no painless choices, but is there also clarity about them? And more broadly, how are we going to translate European policies on reducing strategic dependencies into national policies? In the short term, the CDA expects a letter from the Cabinet on how to mitigate the risks of strategic dependencies at national level and thus contribute to the European ambitions, especially those that have been prioritised by the French Presidency. In this letter, can the cabinet also comment on what the National Growth Fund can do for this purpose? Mr. Chairman. Then I'll join NATO and tomorrow's NATO summit. Russia has disrupted Europe's security structure and NATO is therefore going to substantially increase its presence on the east flank. The Netherlands also places a Patriot unit in Slovakia at NATO's request. The CDA can fully support that commitment. In addition, Lavrov claims that Russia will not allow arms shipments to Ukraine and that they are a legitimate target. The latter would be an unacceptable act of aggression. Is this statement correct and can the Prime Minister also reflect on this? Mr. Chairman. Finally, I look forward to seeing the state of play on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How is the battle going and what else can the Netherlands and NATO do to support the Ukrainians? How can NATO carefully assist Ukraine? The CDA calls for further strengthening of military support to Ukraine.

Finally, Mr President, I would like to say the following about a strong and decisive Europe.

However, the EU is now becoming a military power with the 60 PESCO projects, the European Peace Facility, the European Defence Fund, the Versailles Treaty and now the Strategic Compass with a rapid deployment of 5,000 military forces. Last year, the EU's foreign coordinator spoke of a permanent EU intervention army with as many as 50,000 men. That is why BVNL has the following questions. Are those 5,000 soldiers a first start? What is the long-term plan of this EU mini-ger? How many Dutch soldiers are going to be part of this European mini-army? I don't take it until we solve the staff shortage in our own armed forces. Mr. Chairman. With regard to Ukraine, BVNL's position is unchanged. We strongly condemn the raid, but the Russian people do not want this war and neither do the Ukrainian people. Sanctions have never helped and only affect the Russian people. The language of war in our cabinet does not contribute to a peaceful solution, but leads to discrimination against innocent Russian citizens. Playing war when you've never fired a bullet yourself and aren't willing to die for Ukraine is a risky gospel. That is why BVNL continues to advocate diplomatic actions. The importance of the Netherlands must always prevail. Mr. Chairman. On 3 March, the Council agreed to the preparations for a global pandemic treaty. How was the House of Representatives involved? What exactly is the Prime Minister going to say about the pandemic treaty at the EU summit? How will the House of Representatives be informed about progress in the interim? And how are we involved in decision-making? Mr. Chairman. A large part of the House of Representatives objects to the extension of the European corona certificate. Now we read in a press release that the Council of the EU has already agreed. In addition, a further second extension has been envisaged. Is it true that the Prime Minister has already agreed to the extension of the European corona certificate? How is that consistent with all the objections of the House of Representatives? The Prime Minister will stress at the summit that a patchwork of national measures should be avoided, for example in order to facilitate travel with a QR pass. Does this mean that the Prime Minister is going to advocate an EU approach to corona? BVNL strongly objects to a European approach to corona.

This quote is attributed to Jean Monnet and speaks volumes. Without human enthusiasm and commitment, there is little reality, but without structures that transcend that human being, there is little to hold on to. The logic of this statement goes both ways. Man is capable of something good: building, doing justice, fellow humanity. But man is also capable of evil: destruction, injustice, inhumanity. The latter, too, does not survive without supporting bears who are fighting injustice. Mr. Chairman. Which brings me to the war in Ukraine. The SGP Group strongly supports the efforts of the Putin regime to bring down as much as possible. With economic sanctions towards Russia and the delivery of humanitarian aid and military equipment to Ukraine, we are also trying to do so. Nevertheless, our great dependence on Russian gas is deeply concerned by the SGP. As colleagues have already pointed out, we are talking about Putin's war chest and we can just look forward to a cold winter. I therefore ask the Prime Minister in Brussels to insist on the following three points on this dossier. First of all, flexibility: flexibility in the climate targets to make coal-fired power plants turn harder if necessary, temporarily. Secondly, the suspension of the planned closure of nuclear power stations in Germany and Belgium. Can he argue that? Thirdly, there is the promotion of biogas production, by identifying the mineral concentrate remaining from manure fermentation as a fertilizer substitute in the short term. The latter results in both green gas and fertilizer savings. I would like to comment on these three points. In any case, we still face exciting questions in the coming period. What if Putin continues to defy every frontier of international law and humanity, but still does not violate that red line of violence against NATO? What if Russia continues to commit war crimes? That is why these are my specific questions on this point. What is the humanitarian red line for the cabinet? Will a UN mission be deployed to help enforce a ceasefire or to observe and promote humanitarian aid? Mr. Chairman. Then the Strategic Compass. Following the example of the Ministers for Defence and Foreign Affairs, this Compass must now also be adopted by the Council. The SGP says: let NATO continue to lead as a security organization. Avoid duplication and allow EU coordination, where there is something to be said, never at the expense of national democratic decision-making, including the right of veto. Can the Minister make a commitment on this last point that he will not agree to it? Then a few smaller points. As far as we are concerned, the European coronapas, a hot iron, will be abolished as soon as possible. Does the Prime Minister share our view that this is not necessary at all? The budgetary rules have been relaxed for this year, although the intention is to re-establish the reins next year. Does the Minister agree with us that effective enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact is and remains necessary? The recovery fund has already been warned of precedent and we are now immediately seeing proposals for Euro defence bonds. Does the Prime Minister promise that these will simply not be there and that he will lie down in front of it? Finally, Mr President. The line between good and evil with which I started my contribution runs not between countries and peoples, but through every human heart. Who can say that they only have the purest intentions? Nota bene an apostle, Paul, said: I don't do the good that I want to do, but I do the evil that I don't want to do. Someone like Paul said this, depicted on Roman Catholic prayer cards with a sacred circle above his head, so you know what status he has. It is good to know precisely in this suffering time towards Good Friday and Easter that Christ came into this broken world to heal and renew it. That is the only thing that really holds.

160,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u92,"Thank you very much. President and best residents of the Netherlands, in the Netherlands you have the saying ""better a good neighbor than a distant friend."" Especially now in turbulent times with a lot of struggle and conflict, the importance of good neighbours should not be underestimated. This requires good cooperation, both within NATO and within the EU. However, in my opinion, the EU has not been looking for cooperation over the last few decades, but rather sees the opportunity for a massive expansion of its dominant position. Commission President Von der Leyen and her colleagues see only one solution to all the issues of today: more EU. It is up to the Prime Minister and his colleagues to calm down the European Commission in this area. During the war in Ukraine, the European Commission tries to play a little NATO. She wants to deliver weapons and show herself by bringing out hasty statements. The NATO alliance is watching over our collective security and has been doing so very successfully for more than half a century. The Netherlands is not waiting for the European Commission's amateurism in this area. I'd rather put our safety in the hands of Stoltenberg than in the hands of Von der Leyen. Does the Prime Minister agree with the BBB that there is a risk that responsibilities will cross over? What do our American allies think of this new attitude in Brussels? This also seems to me to be important in setting up a new Rapid Deployment Capacity, bringing 5,000 European soldiers quickly on their feet. The Foreign Minister has promised Dutch troops to do so. Working together for our common security is inevitable, but the Prime Minister must be crystal clear in Brussels. Only the Dutch cabinet and parliament will decide on the use of Dutch military, now and in the future. So no EU army. Why is this important? Because the House of Representatives is the only representative of the entire Dutch people. Only we can choose whether or not to put Dutch lives at risk of war. Moreover, I can then directly control the Minister, while I can only call the European Commission to account indirectly or at all. I'd like the Prime Minister's view on this. Mr. Chairman. How many times have farmers and I have said that we need a war or famine before we start to appreciate food production again. Besides oxygen and water, food is one of the first three necessities. Without one of those three, you're just gonna die. This is something that few people have considered in recent decades, because there was food in abundance. Here in the Netherlands we have been trading fertile agricultural land for solar parks, data centers, distribution centers and wish nature for years. The Hedwigepolder is flooded for the benefit of the Westerschelde. Fertile fields and meadows become ponds. Farmers must be expropriated and bought out for a paper nitrogen problem. What do we really need these farmers, growers, growers and fishermen for? Food's just in the store, right? Or worse, as former VVD leader and now paid environmental guru Ed Nijpels said to me last year: Mrs Van der Plas, farmers occupy two thirds of our country. ""Occupying,"" how do you get it out of your mouth? How do you get it out of your mouth that's fed by those same farmers? That land is often simply the property of farmers. These farmers make good for the people, safe, sustainable and affordable food. That's what they give back for that ""occupied"" country. That is forgotten for a moment, completely detached from reality. Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, a terrible war is needed to wake up governments as well. The French President and good friend of our Prime Minister, Emmanuel Macron, has already rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. He has announced a major shift in the French agricultural policy. The main focus of the French agricultural policy will be food independence. France will prioritize this over the goals of the EU Green Deal. Macron speaks of a deep food crisis, which makes it important to increase the production capacity of European agriculture and adapt the Van-Boer-to-Bord strategy. What is the position of the Netherlands in this regard? Is the Prime Minister prepared to consult with his colleagues on adapting the Green Deal and the Farm to Fork packages to prevent production losses? Can the Prime Minister give us a feedback on the commitment of our Minister for Agriculture in this area at the last Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Europe? Finally, Mr President. In 1950, half a hectare of agricultural land was available to every world citizen. At that time, 2.5 billion citizens were involved. By 2050 this is only 0.17 hectares of agricultural land per person, with a world population of 9 to 10 billion. Food production shouldn't go down, but it should go up. Let us never forget that 0.3% of the population feeds the other 99.7%.",True,0.077,0.81,0.113,0.9753,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 63, Session 8 (2022-03-23)",2022-03-23,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 8,Meeting 63,Sitting 2022-03-23,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,BBB,Boeren Burger Beweging,Opposition,Centre-right,CarolinevanderPlas,"van der Plas, Caroline",F,1967,55.0,True,3
161,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u130,"Mr. Chairman. Just to manage expectations, questions have been asked about the pandemic treaty. There will be a great deal of discussion with NATO tomorrow, and then with the European Council, but not with the pandemic treaty. That's what's going on here. I had that questioned on March 29th at the Health Council. A letter was also sent to the Chamber by the VWS Minister about that Health Council. It's also going into the pandemic treaty. More than that letter says, I don't have any here. I don't even have that letter here. I should ask for that. Then I'm gonna read the letter, but you can read it yourself. That's all I know. So I'm gonna leave it there for a while. The second is that I have to inform you in advance that the agenda of the European Council has been slightly modified. First of all, the President of Ukraine will also call by video link. That's one. The second is that the eurozone summit was postponed to June. Some questions have been asked about this. Of course, I'll just answer it. But the eurozone summit itself is going to June. Another item on the agenda has then been added to this European Council. We should have reported that to the Chamber by now. That didn't happen by mistake. This is about the re-election of the President of the European Council. The last time it was announced by the French President that he would consult the Council on this matter as a foreman or forewoman, but in this case it is a foreman of the country holding the rotating Presidency. There seems to be broad support among Member States for the re-election of Charles Michel, the current President of the European Council. I think it's right to report that here, too. I will, of course, include in the European Council's report whether or not that happens. That's all for the administration if that's all right with you, Mr. Chairman. I've had a lot of questions. I would like to start with the questions about how we are currently indicating the military situation in Ukraine and everything related to it, including diplomatic matters and the negotiations that are going on everywhere. Let me begin by saying that I agree with the many speakers who have said that the situation on the ground is terrible. In many respects, this situation is tragic as a result of Russia's inconsequential aggression. It is clear that the Russian attack is not going according to plan at the moment. The advance is progressing slowly; that actually indicates all the sources we can find. The Russian invasion force faces huge losses, logistical problems and also low morale among the troops. Also the Ukrainian resistance, as we can see, is much brighter than expected. The downside of this slow march is, of course, that Russia's action is becoming more brutal and more violent and that, through the siege of cities and the use of imprecise bombings, there are now large-scale devastations and large numbers of civilian casualties. That's the actual picture we're seeing right now, and it's very difficult to predict how it's going to go on. Actually, I'm not gonna risk it. I can only conclude that the situation is as it is, that we need to prepare for all possible scenarios and that we should not rule out Russia trying to push ahead with further bombings or new offensives. But whether that will succeed, we will of course see for the next few days and weeks. Of course, we are very involved in what Volodymyr Zelensky is doing and in the way he is leading Ukraine and the resistance, and also in the military response to the terrible Russian aggression. Of course, in that context, I think all diplomatic initiatives should now focus on stopping bloodshed. Mr Van der Lee and Mrs Piri, as well as many others, asked. Refugees must be able to leave the bombed cities. In the UN context, Russia is currently blocking effective measures; we need to be honest about that. The blockade of Russia means that the OSCE cannot actually do anything at the moment. I was in Turkey yesterday, with President Erdogan. Turkey has a special position because it has condemned Russia's aggression. In this sense, Turkey has reacted more firmly than, for example, India. I call India because the Prime Minister of India is in contact with both Russia and Ukraine. But the difference with Turkey is that Turkey has also expressed a firm condemnation of Russian aggression. At the moment, the President himself but also Çavuşoglu, the Foreign Minister, is trying to see from that position of contact with both Russia and Ukraine what is possible to possibly come up with a form of consultation or negotiation. Of course, we will have to wait and see if that will work, but I think that this type of initiative is very important. You will also find in the public sources which themes are involved. That has to do with that bizarre claim of denazification, as Putin called it. It also has to do with security guarantees over and over again. It also has to do with issues surrounding the Russian minority in Ukraine. However, and you can also find this in the public sources, it is also about how it continues in a possible peace treaty with the Donbas, the two oblasts around Luhansk and Donetsk and Crimea. It's very difficult to predict how that's going to happen right now. My assessment is that, if this is to lead to something, especially on those big issues of Donbas and Crimea, there is ultimately a need for a direct dialogue between Ukraine and Russia, and that it is not possible to rule out that such a conversation, if it is to be successful, should take place at the highest level. And of course, we don't know if that's an option. That too is decided in the future. Moreover, the UN has a difficult position in this conflict. The United Nations sg is currently being hampered by Russia in direct mediation between the warring parties. Moscow is actually putting him away as biased, but he is definitely meddling behind the scenes. He is also in close contact with third countries such as Turkey, Israel and India. And, of course, this contact with both capitals also applies to France, Germany and America, but of course they also have a very strong position in terms of sanctions and the attitude of the Western world. But the special position here is, of course, particularly the Israeli Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of India and the President of Turkey, as has already been mentioned. In the United Nations, the condemnation of aggression was pronounced in a session of all countries. It has been supported by 141 Member States. One of the objectives of Dutch diplomacy is to keep that group together, in close coordination with our allies, because not all 141 Member States are by definition equally motivated. You need to keep that group together and, if possible, extend it to include the 30 plus countries that have expressed themselves neutrally in that resolution. It is important to make the coalition of 141 countries grow and not shrink. From Europe, this is what we are trying to do from the Netherlands to contact Macky Sall, the holder of the rotating presidency of the African Union, but also with India, Indonesia, South Africa and other countries, in order to ensure that the coalition is as successful as possible.",True,0.08,0.84,0.08,-0.2371,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 63, Session 8 (2022-03-23)",2022-03-23,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 8,Meeting 63,Sitting 2022-03-23,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,MarkRutte,"Rutte, Mark",M,1967,55.0,False,3
162,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u146,"For this it may be relevant that Wopke Hoekstra, our own Foreign Minister, last Tuesday spoke to Wang Yi, the state counselor, so say the man who is seen as very important in the foreign political field of China. He said that in the eyes of the Dutch and the Western world China should use its influence to move Russia towards a cease-fire as quickly as possible. We think it would be extremely important if China were to be more visible there. The Chinese Government, as we can see, relies on the principles of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will then, of course, point out to them that this is now very true of Ukraine. We also point out to them that the economic crisis that is now arising from the major problems surrounding Ukraine and aggression can, of course, also affect China. We shall therefore continue to do so both bilaterally and multilaterally. The EU will do the same at the forthcoming EU-China summit. That is not a summit with all 27 countries, but with institutions. By doing so, we make it clear that China's constructive role is not a favour to the West, and that this is not at the expense of our commitment to other tensions in the relationship with China, such as human rights and unfair trade. Those tensions must all be addressed as well. Mr. Chairman. Then maybe a few more things. If the European Union is called upon as an institution to participate in the negotiations, the EU is ready to do so. But at the moment there is very close contact between the EU Member States, but certainly also with Ukraine. Yesterday, the already mentioned Hoekstra had a long talk with Kuleba, Ukraine's Foreign Minister. I myself had contact with Zelensky the day before yesterday in the run-up to the visit to Turkey. It is also true that Michel, the President of the European Council, Scholz, the Chancellor of Germany, and Macron, the President of France, consult Putin very regularly. The question in that context is what is the focus of the summit that is coming. A lot of MPs, including Sjoerdsma, Van Dijk, Kamminga and others, asked that question. It is an extraordinary Summit in the context of Russian aggression in Ukraine. The consequences of the Russian invasion on Ukraine will be discussed, as well as on the alliance, both for the present and for the longer term, as far as that is concerned. We will, of course, express the alliance's support for Ukraine, both politically and financially, but also militaryly, with what we can now do by providing military resources and further strengthening NATO's deterrent and defence in response to this new reality. It is important that American President Joe Biden is physically present at the summit. A joint statement will be published. This will also be done at the European Council with the EU Member States. It is foreseen that Biden is also present. In the case of the Netherlands, we are committed to this solidarity, humanitarian and, of course, economic and military at the NATO summit. It is also important to strengthen and maintain the alliance: unity and co-ordinated cooperation with partners, such as the European Union. Further steps are also important to ensure that NATO can increase defence and deterrent. I will also draw attention tomorrow to the continuing preparation of NATO for all conceivable scenarios. The right decision-making has been secured. NATO is a military and political alliance with a record since 1949. Decisions shall be taken on the basis of political-military advice from the NATO staff. Of course, the deployment of troops always requires a political decision by consensus in the NAR, the North Atlantic Council, where ambassadors normally do the work. Among other things, Mr Amhaouch's question was what NATO could do more in that context. I think we are doing the best we can right now, as far as possible. Much more would entail the risk of direct confrontation between NATO and Russia in the military sense. We will continue to work hard to deliver military goods, humanitarian aid and medicines, and we will continue to work on sanction packages. Maybe I'll come back to that. Within the alliance, NATO has for years supported both political and practical reforms in Ukraine through a trust fund, to which the Netherlands has also contributed, cooperation on interoperability and joint exercises and, of course, very important, in hybrid threats. Obviously, the situation has changed since the invasion. In that context, the no-fly zone is not on the table, I say to Mr Sjoerdsma, however difficult it is, because it is the conviction that this would indeed be an escalation with the risk of direct confrontation. Then the future. That was also a question from Mr Sjoerdsma. We cannot see exactly what is going to happen now and what it means for our relationship with Putin and the Russian regime. We must point out that we did not impose these sanctions for nothing. Would it be possible to hope for a sort of negotiated solution between Russia and Ukraine at this time..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... If that were a solution that we believe would be too much at gunpoint, under a massive Russian threat, it would not be automatic that the sanctions should expire. NATO, the European Union, America and the United Kingdom will then have to make a joint assessment of the significance of this possible agreement. Anyway, let us hope that it comes to that and let us hope that it has a form that does not give us the impression that it has come under such pressure that Ukraine has gone down its knees.

164,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-23-tweedekamer-8.u255,"Everything we can prepare is being prepared, but at the moment Russia's aggression in Marioepol and elsewhere is such that it does not seem to me to be a passable road. The maximum you can do is to promote the corridors et cetera. I don't know the message about those 11 parties. I should check it out. I just don't know, and that's why I don't want to respond to rumors like that right now. I really need to be sure. Mr. Chairman. Maybe I can go straight to the core of the Strategic Compass. We have a number of initiatives in Europe, such as the EU training missions in Iraq, Mali and elsewhere. The purpose of the intervention force is not to stop the Russians or other major international conflicts. The purpose of this is to see if we, as Europe, can be able to do a few things ourselves in special situations, especially outside the NATO framework, but not, of course, in conflict with NATO. Think, for example, of evacuations or minor crisis operations. I think the situation in Kabul would have been too big a problem to solve with a rapid European intervention force. We have had a major problem there with the evacuation of nationals and others who depended on our protection. We intend to be able to carry out such operations as the European Union with this rapid reaction force in 2025, but that is, of course, completely separate from the defence of the territory and the NATO task. It's not a European army. The Netherlands has also made no proposals for the creation of a European army. There are no such proposals. Of course, participation always takes place on the basis of national decision-making, both on the provision of military services and capacity. So it does not replace the collective defence offered by NATO. Maybe I can also answer a few other questions right away, otherwise we will hear the question I might just want to answer again. In the Strategic Compass it is foreseen that this intervention force will be there in 2025, with 5,000 people. The Netherlands wants to contribute to this, because we think that this is a sensible addition to what Europe is doing, as I just outlined. Again, of course it remains a Dutch competence to participate or not. It also builds on the current EU Battlegroups. It's actually an improved version of what already exists. This could be used in evacuation missions or crisis management near Europe. Once again, it is not an army, nor is it in conflict with NATO. The decision-making process, Mrs Van der Plas and others asked for a Dutch competence. We then look each year at which countries choose to participate or stand by. Germany said it wants to be lead nation by 2025. That will therefore have to be a different country every year. Finally, another question from Mrs Kamminga on this issue. It has to do with NATO and additional troops to the east flank. That's right. Many additional measures have already been taken, such as the activation of defence plans and the higher readiness. Several allies are now working on a multinational basis on additional Battlegroups on the east flank. We are working with the French to see what we can do in Romania. In addition to the Romanian initiative, a Patriotic Air Defence Unit is planned to go to Slovakia in April. The expectation is that these Battlegroups will eventually be brought under the NATO flag, depending on military advice. Then they morph into, as it were, a kind of Enhanced Forward Presence. In the Baltic countries, by the way, there is also the ambition to enhance enhanced Forward Presence in enhanced forward defence. These are, of course, all decisions that we will have to take later. That would also mean more permanent presence. This discussion is ongoing, but I see it moving towards decision-making in June. So it is also a structural adjustment of the NATO posture, that is, our presence, to the eastern flank in the longer term. Then perhaps in that same context a few more things. Mrs Van der Plas asks: are you not afraid that NATO and EU responsibilities will bite each other? No, I don't think so. It's an en-en approach. Article 5 of NATO stands for our collective defence, and within the European Union it is wise that you are able to do things that are not directly related to your defence, but are related to what I just outlined, such as logistics operations, but also evacuations, for example. Mr Sjoerdsma asked: is that Strategic Compass enough for the longer term? I think we're really taking a few big steps here. That's what's needed. There is a collective awareness that we need to invest in security. Moreover, I believe that further cooperation within the European Union is really helping to make smarter use of our capabilities. Of course, you can already see the Netherlands working with Germany in a highly integrated way when it comes to the army. You see that in a lot of places. We also work with the Belgians in air defense, of course. I believe that the current crisis underlines the urgency of this EU defence cooperation. Then Mr Van Dijk asked: shouldn't we act hastily? It's always wise not to do that, but I don't think we do that here. We could not make the draft public, because we were bound by EU rules. But we have now shared the public appreciations of the five drafts and their policy implications with the Chamber. We have also discussed our commitment with the Chamber in advance of the Council meetings. The Sjoerdsma motion on the increase in defence expenditure calls for an investigation into whether there can be structural additional investment in defence, also in view of the 2% agreement with NATO members. This is in addition to the 25% additional defence expenditure from the coalition agreement. We know that motion. It's accepted, too. The possibilities for additional investment are now being mapped out by the Secretary of Defense. The Chamber shall be informed as soon as possible. We will then inform the Chamber at the latest of any additional resources for defence, or if possible earlier, for example in the Defence Note. The question was also how to prevent the situation from changing the whole security system by 2024. There have been elections in the United States again, and you don't know how that goes. I think you should say here that the transatlantic alliance is essential for European security. That's what this crisis shows. NATO remains the cornerstone of our collective defence and security. Our transatlantic approach remains crucial, hence the relationship with the United States and Canada, which are of great importance. Honestly, no matter who's in the White House. It goes beyond the White House. Think, for example, of the great support for NATO and European security in Congress. The Republicans and Democrats are also aware that if Russia were to have a greater influence in this part of Europe, it would ultimately have a major impact on the security of the United States. We only have to go back 80 years in history or we go back to the end of World War I to understand how crucial it is for the security of the United States that Europe is stable. So apart from historical ties and historical obligations, there is also a very pragmatic reason for the United States to continue to invest heavily in NATO, provided that we do so. That is why defence expenditure must also be increased. That's what we're lucky to do. This will also make the relationship with the United States more equal, more effective and thus more future-proof. Otherwise, it would naturally come under pressure in the long term. Finally, there was the question of private investment. I understand that this is about measures to improve the access of the defence industry to private finance. Then it's about access to loans from banks. That seems to me to be a good thing. We need a strong defence industry in Europe that can also be technologically successful. Mr. Chairman.

Can the Prime Minister come back to that point before the next Foreign Affairs Council? I think there was one more question that the Prime Minister had not yet come back to or which I myself missed; I would like to leave that in the middle.

This is independent of the way in which it is intended to be used. If, for example, the American Government were to say that we are only using our army for humanitarian missions and airport security, no one will say that America no longer has an army.

168,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12.u12,"Otherwise, I'd do it, but it's perfectly clear. Good. Mr. Chairman. I would like to return to President Zelensky's speech this morning, which we have all listened to with great respect and great appreciation. I think we have all felt that the President, with his determination, is a symbol of the struggle that the Ukrainians are currently fighting. President Zelensky has also become, as a human being, the embodiment of the Ukrainian courage that we see. He inspires his fellow countrymen to continue to fight and to prevent the aggression caused by Putin from achieving its goal. He named something that, I think, arrived at all of us. He said, ""The war's been going on for 36 days and, if we're not careful, the bombings are going to be routine right now."" War must never get used to it. I think we all realized that this morning. The Dutch cabinet, the Prime Minister, of course has a lot of contact with President Zelensky, and we with our colleagues and other people in Ukraine. That's incredibly important. We are always sending out the message that we are not abandoning Ukraine, that the Ukrainians can continue to count on our support and that we are listening to them to understand exactly what they need and where we can help them. Mr President, I would also like to thank you for having a delegation from a cabinet here today. It is good to have this debate to repeat what we are doing. What we are doing is: maximum pressure on Russia, maximum support to Ukraine. And, of course, from NATO, we are doing what is necessary to guarantee the security of the allies. Mr. Chairman. I shall begin with the situation in Ukraine. How is the war developing? The situation is, of course, constantly evolving, but we can identify a number of things. Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, is just under Ukraine's control. That's incredibly important. We see that Russian units are suffering losses and the pace of the ground offensive has decreased. Gradually you see some static fronts. We also see that occasionally both Russian and Ukrainian forces book land profits, one way or the other. Grosso mode isn't changing that map very much. We have the claim of last Friday's Russian General Rutskoi. He said: the first phase of the war has been successful and actually completed. He said that Russia has managed to significantly reduce the impact of the Ukrainian armed forces. At least that's an incomplete picture. The focus of Russian forces seems to have shifted to the Donbas in recent days, but it is not yet possible for us to see that the Russian armed forces have actually reduced activities around Kiev and Chernivtsi. And that was the commitment of the Russian negotiations in Istanbul. It was the announcement made by Russia. So I'm skeptical. I'd much rather say it's a nice first step. I would like to say that there is reason for optimism. But I recall what we heard from the Russian side before the invasion, namely that there was only an exercise and that there would be no invasion. I therefore think that we should be able to see for ourselves that it is actually happening before we attach too much importance to it. I do not want to detract from the importance of the negotiations, I fully agree with what has just been said about them, but we do not yet see it. So, on Mrs Kamminga's question, whether it is a tipping point, I do not dare say yes at all. Of course, from the Defense Department, we monitor developments very well. If it is, we will signal it, and I will say so. We see that the shelling of Ukrainian cities continues. Then it's about Kiev, Chernihiv, Sumy, Charkov, Mykolajiv. It actually goes on all the time. The most horrible images are from Marioepol. There's the most difficult situation. There are actually no words to describe the humanitarian situation there by now. It's actually getting worse. Despite attempts to organise humanitarian security corridors, we can see that they have only limited success. Those were my answers to what has been asked and what I can say about the military situation and the war itself.",True,0.093,0.749,0.157,0.9951,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 67, Session 12 (2022-03-31)",2022-03-31,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 12,Meeting 67,Sitting 2022-03-31,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,3

170,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12.u19,"Fine. I'll make sure of that. I come to the questions that have been asked about the help we can provide. We have, of course, heard the call from President Zelensky. We have heard them not only today, but also before and also in the contacts we have with the Ukrainians. It is clear what Zelensky is asking for, what Ukraine is asking for. We're trying to respond to that as best we can. I have heard the questions raised by Mrs Mulder, Mrs Kamminga, Mr Ceder, Mr Dassen and others. I am going to try to give answers, but the Chamber also knows that the cabinet decided rather soon after the invasion not to give any details in public about the nature of military support. The Chamber shall be informed confidentially. Then it's about the type of weapons systems and military goods we supply to Ukraine. We have made that decision ourselves. Many countries have decided to deal with it in this way, because it also entails operational risks if you do communicate about it in public. Moreover, we are not helping Ukraine if it is so clear, even for Russia, what is being delivered. I am very much aware that some countries make other considerations. By the way, that is perfectly understandable. I can say that Mr Van Dijk and others have previously informed us that we have already delivered more than EUR 50 million in military goods from our own stock. The counter's still running. In other words, we are still in the process of delivering. It is a footnote, but I would like to say for the sake of completeness that the sum of more than 50 million is about the book value of the items and not about the possible replacement value. I'm afraid it's all become a lot more expensive by now. That's irrelevant, but I don't want the Chamber to remember that. In other words, we deliver and, of course, we see if we can miss it. But we're trying to make a very critical assessment. If there's anything we can do, we'll deliver it. We sometimes ask for goods that we don't have in stock ourselves. We can buy them sometimes. That's also a route we're on. The third thing I want to say is that there is international consultation. We consult with our international partners to see what we can do more together. Then it's about logistics, but also about who can do what, how can we acquire it and how can we deliver it. That has now become a combination that works well in itself. That is important, because giving that help is crucial, just as President Zelensky indicated. Mr. Chairman. In this context, there were a few questions. I hope I've answered the questions about the weapons. Then I would like to move on to a number of other questions.",True,0.04,0.851,0.109,0.9888,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 67, Session 12 (2022-03-31)",2022-03-31,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 12,Meeting 67,Sitting 2022-03-31,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,3
171,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12.u27,"What is being delivered to Ukraine are indeed gifts. I think we included that in the letter of inquiry. We'll give it to Ukraine. Nothing's coming back. The only question we keep asking ourselves is: do we finance it ourselves and, if so, from what resources will it be paid, or is it something that fits within the criteria of the funds made available at European level? But of course that is administered neatly on the cabinet side. Those are the two ways to finance the donations of military equipment. Mr. Chairman. Mr Kuzu van Denk asked about the possibility of contributing to the protection of citizens in the event of air strikes. If I understand him correctly, it was mainly about protecting Ukrainian citizens from air strikes, so in Ukraine itself. That is a debate that has been held here more often. Of the requests that have been made earlier about setting up a no-fly zone, NATO has said that we cannot do that without becoming part of the conflict ourselves. This has potentially very far-reaching consequences. So you can't. Anything that leads NATO to become active in Ukraine can't, because then you become directly party. What can be done is to supply military goods that enable Ukraine to defend itself against them. So that is how we can contribute to protecting citizens. Then there were a few questions before I got through the lyrics. Mr Van der Staaij of the SGP said that, in addition to what we are doing to support Ukraine, we may also need to increase our own defence efforts. Of course, we support Ukraine. We'll do what NATO wants us to do. We are, of course, also thinking with NATO about what is sensible. We have taken steps at European level when it comes to defence and security. The cabinet is very aware of the fact that the Chamber has also asked for this. There's a Sjoerdsma motion. Following the Sjoerdsma motion, the cabinet said that we need to see whether we can take further steps on top of what was already made available from the coalition agreement at the beginning of this cabinet, namely 3 billion structural and 10.7 billion for this cabinet period. We think this is relevant. The motion that has been passed here, of course, we will work out. We will also come up with proposals. Of course, you can see this in other countries, particularly in Europe. And, not unimportantly, you can also see this with our neighbours, the Germans, who, of course, have taken a big step and are just going to do the 2% for NATO. So the answer is: yes, we also think that we should increase our defence efforts. We believe that this is not so much because we believe that this is now contributing to the war in Ukraine, but because we want, in the long term, to get defence in order within the framework of NATO and the European Union. Of course, that will take time, but it is very important to do it. Mr Sjoerdsma asked about the long-term commitment. That was also about NATO. That was actually about the defense and, in particular, the reinforcement of the east flank. We are of course active in this, but Mr Sjoerdsma is right that these are in principle temporary contributions for the time being. This is also how eFP was launched in Lithuania. We've been there for five years. For example, we now have a commitment for Bulgaria's airspace. That's basically temporary. F-35s are going to fly there for two months in cooperation with others. The Patriots in Slovakia are in principle also a temporary commitment. I think this is also good in principle, because it allows you to switch very quickly. We flew within one and a half hours of the invasion. Then the first F-35 went into the air. The commitments for Bulgaria and Slovakia have also gone quickly. The development is very soon, early April. You can still make agreements about how you want to stick with NATO after that, but the first step has been taken. NATO is also considering the long-term strategy. At various meetings of the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Defence, and ultimately at the NATO Summit, a decision will have to be taken on how we see this in the slightly longer term.",True,0.019,0.883,0.098,0.9944,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 67, Session 12 (2022-03-31)",2022-03-31,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 12,Meeting 67,Sitting 2022-03-31,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,3
172,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-12.u29,"I think it is a very important point that Mr Sjoerdsma makes. I think it is also very important to say that NATO must have a plan, a strategy in its entirety. So the step that is now being taken by Germany and the Netherlands together to quickly develop these Patriot units is the first step. The second question that comes with this is: do you want to do so in the longer term, and how are we going to keep it up with each other? Then indeed, as allies, you must see how to secure that. If we, the Netherlands, can make a contribution to this, then that is certainly an option. However, we need to make a total balance as to whether the Netherlands can and should be able to do so or whether there are perhaps other allies who are going to step in there. Then, of course, it is up to Slovakia. I cannot decide for them what they do with their own equipment. Mr. Chairman. I hope that I have answered most of the questions in this way, and I have thus also done justice to the encouragement we received this morning from President Zelensky to continue to focus on what we can do. I was in Leeuwarden yesterday at a major NATO exercise. That's called Frisian Flag and these are flying exercises, where we practice together with a large number of partners. Then one of the kites said something about the different countries that were there with their planes. He said: it is very important that we do not only meet during a conflict, but that we practice together and that we know that we are ready for the effort. And then I thought, ""Yeah, that's exactly what this is about."" And I also think it is appropriate to express my thanks here to the military, who indeed, as I have just said, went into the air one and a half hours after the raid and all the others who are ready, day and night, to carry out their duties in the context of our security.

173,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-13.u19,"Thank you, Mr President. Seven months ago, Afghanistan lost the battle for democracy. With the coming into power of the Taliban, most of the Afghans who are left behind reside in that country under plight conditions. During the hectic weeks after the fall of Kabul, the Netherlands evacuated about 2,000 people, including 1,110 Afghans who were at risk from their work for the Netherlands and the wider mission. Mr. Chairman. Afghanistan. One would almost forget because of the focus on Ukraine, but Afghanistan is now facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world due to a shortage of food and medical aid since the takeover by the Taliban. More than 23 million people, including many children, risk extreme poverty. Trafficking in human beings is the order of the day. Renal sales are still on a daily basis. In addition, the situation of women and girls is truly appalling. My group is therefore extremely concerned about the 1,102 people on the Dutch evacuation list, including interpreters of the Dutch mission, who are still left behind under horrible conditions in Afghanistan. These people aren't sure of their lives. Many have gone into hiding and are forced to change places of residence. There is also a group of certainly dozens of people on the evacuation list who are trapped in Pakistan. I would therefore like to ask the Minister what the latest state of affairs is with regard to this group. In addition, several hundred relatives of already evacuated Afghans are waiting for evacuation and reunification with their families. We therefore call on the Cabinet to do everything possible to evacuate these people as soon as possible. Mr. Chairman. The situation for the people left behind on the evacuation list is very dangerous. The cries we hear only underline the urgency of the situation. We hear stories on the news such as the interpreter for the Dutch police mission, who was murdered by the Taliban in cold blood on the day of the Parliamentary debate on the evacuations on 14 October 2021. Many family members are at risk because of the work of their father or other family members, the so-called derivative risk. We know cases of young mature sons who have been arrested and tortured because they are related to evacuated Afghans. It is therefore really important to speed up the evacuations as much as possible. I call again on the government to do so. Mr. Chairman. There are a number of points that I do not understand and which, in fact, amaze me. From the reflection and analysis of the evacuation in Afghanistan in the report of the Crisis Plan Bureau, we read that Mr Belhaj's motion of 18 August did not facilitate the evacuation operation: the additional influx increased the burden on the small group of diplomats and soldiers, who had to go to extremes. I would like a reflection from the cabinet, because I also read in the letter of the state of affairs that all recommendations are considered useful. It seems to me to be the reverse world to criticize a motion by a Member of Parliament asking for more commitment from the government. Mr. Chairman. Linked to this, I also read that the well-meaning interventions of Dutch MPs who were in direct contact with people in Kabul, which Mr Boswijk mentioned among others, did not lighten the task for the Dutch military and diplomats in Kabul and sometimes created dramatic dilemmas for them. I get that. We must indeed support these people and I have great respect for the diplomats and the military who have intervened with danger for their own lives. At the same time, however, I would say that if the government and, in particular, the previous rulers had really done their job of evacuating those people, those well-meaning interventions by Members of Parliament would not have been necessary at all. As far as I am concerned, that is the order to be followed. In that sense, I found those comments in the Crisis Plan report far too easy.

I asked what the expectation is, how much longer does the cabinet think this evacuation is going to go on? Are we talking about a year? Are we talking about several years? So I didn't intend to set a date here this afternoon. Finally, I would like to point out that there has just been another debate on the interruption with Mr Stoffer and Mrs Belhaj, so it is at the risk that they will be back at the interrupting microphone, a passage from the report The evacuation from Afghanistan, from Crisis Plan. There's another appreciation. The question that Mr Stoffer has already asked and the conclusions that have already been drawn are quite right. Fortunately, we will also be discussing this report at a later date if the appreciation of the cabinet is there. However, I would still like to name one important lesson from that report here, a lesson that we should take on board as the House of Representatives. I quote: ""The well-meaning interventions of MPs who were in direct contact with people in Kabul did not lighten the task for the Dutch military and diplomats in Kabul and sometimes created dramatic dilemmas for them. Also, the flow of parliamentary questions reached the Ministry in the middle of the crisis has not done the effectiveness of the crisis operation well. Several policy staff had to be made free day and night for this.""

175,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-13.u53,"""Education is our right. Open the schools."" That's what the women and girls from the Ministry of Education called last Saturday in Kabul. Under the Taliban regime, the right to education for women and girls has been virtually made impossible. The protest, the resistance and the appeal are an act of courage for an Afghanistan where fundamental rights, including for women and girls, are guaranteed. In the past not everything was better, but in Afghanistan over the past few years women and girls could study and work, partly because of the commitment of the Netherlands. In the last summer, everything changed. On August 15, Kabul fell and began the major evacuation operation. It became the priority for the Netherlands to bring all people who had worked for Dutch interest to safety as soon as possible. This was the least we could do for people who had often worked for years at risk for their own lives. This was and is a Chamberwide shared sentiment. Mr. Chairman. My colleagues have asked a number of questions, including about the guards and the laissez-passers, which I would like to join. I thank the cabinet for the letter, but I would like to make a few comments. One. I have a number of questions about the precarious situation there and the completion of the evacuation. The letter provides insight into the numbers: are people still in Afghanistan or are they in the Netherlands? But under what circumstances or in what situation people are still in Afghanistan, there is no answer to that. The Minister calls it ""precary situations."" I want to know if people are safe or if they have to go into hiding. Does this also restrict people from trying to flee the country? I'd like a response. It is possible that the precarious situation in which we are in may prevent us from being transferred. We must be careful to ensure that after making a concrete suggestion to transfer, as stated in the letter, we conclude that people cannot be transferred and so we leave them there. I'd like a reaction to this, too. In the small debate I had with Mr Valstar this was also about. Mr. Chairman. The predecessor of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Knapen, gave an example of the wife of a Dutch Afghan. Due to the death of her husband, her right to come to the Netherlands formally expired. Mr Knapen said the following. ""Did you really think that we would abandon such a woman there? Did you really think so? Of course you don't. No hair on your head thinks about abandoning someone like that."" In all groups to be transferred there are such cases to think of. What is the implementation of this and what are the possible bottlenecks? Mr. Chairman. The Netherlands has 25 additional people. The question to the Secretary of State is how this happened and whether these 650 people are divided among European countries. Mr. Chairman. Then looking forward. We must never find ourselves in a situation like this again. There's a mission in Mali right now where there's a lot of uncertainty. The Chamber adopted a motion, the Belhaj motion in part No. 29 (35925-X), on the responsibilities of the Dutch state towards local personnel on military missions. In order to ensure that a possible evacuation in Mali does not take place as in Afghanistan, I ask the Minister whether he can answer the question as to what is going on with the implementation of the adopted motion. Does staff know where it is? Does it know whether it is being helped in the event of an emergency or whether they should organise something at their own risk? I'm trying to pronounce this as nuanced as possible, but I realize that I actually find it very, very, very sad. The evaluation states that if that motion had not been tabled, we could have done our job well. We asked for policies in 2016. We asked for policies in 2019. It's escalating. We're filing a motion. I would ask you to at least make a policy. And we're eight months away. I don't really understand that. In fact, I do not understand that in such a way that I suggest that in a month's time there is simply a letter in the Chamber with an impact on policy. Mr. Chairman. I'm almost there. We have not or hardly been dealing with Afghanistan in the last five weeks, because there is a war on the European continent. I would also like to make a comment. We are showing towards Ukraine that in five weeks we can do an incredible deal as government, nationwide and local, and as a society. We catch people at et cetera. Of course, the situations are far from identical, but I note that political leadership, decisiveness and humanity are at the root of the impossible. That is why, in my opinion, this can never be an abundance. I call on the Ministers and the Secretary of State to allow the Netherlands, with political leadership, decisiveness and humanity, to take on its duty and responsibility in Afghanistan.",True,0.054,0.864,0.082,0.9623,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-13,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 67, Session 13 (2022-03-31)",2022-03-31,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 13,Meeting 67,Sitting 2022-03-31,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,SalimaBelhaj,"Belhaj, Salima",F,1978,44.0,True,3
176,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-13.u154,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank all Members for their input in the first term. It's the first time I've been allowed to talk to the Chamber about Afghanistan. I would like to repeat what some have already said today, namely that the eyes of the world are now focused on Ukraine. But our important work for Afghanistan and the people in Afghanistan continues. It is important to talk about this as well. In the past period I have tried to explore what has been going on here and what is still going on here. I did that by reading files, of course, but also by talking to people. Among other things, I spoke with evacuated interpreters, who are in the Netherlands with their families. I also spoke with soldiers who were directly involved in Kabul last August, and also in Islamabad. So they did the evacuation. I spoke to officials who were on the crisis team and then worked 24/7 to man that crisis team and bring the people here. Their stories have given me an image of a very profound and very intensive period, just as some of the people present have undoubtedly experienced it. I am truly grateful to all those who have worked hard for the proper execution and successful outcome of the evacuation. But we're not done yet. That is why we are here today to talk about what we are doing and what we can do in the current circumstances and with the efforts we are making to do so. Of course, we also need to learn lessons. We do not need to wait for the evaluations, which are very important. What we can do already, we have to do. I shall now turn to Mrs Belhaj's question. It is incredibly important that we will be able to learn lessons for the future thanks to good and detailed research. Mr. Chairman. I'm just wondering the questions. I've tried to cluster them a little bit. I'll start with Mr Stoffer. He asked: if you look at, for example, the debate this Chamber held on 8 July on the interpretation dossier and if you look at how things were going in August and how things are going now, how do you judge it? I'm just going to summarize his question. Partly, of course, the research will be about that. We will see what the Ruys Committee will say about this. But now, when I look at that period, I see what happened when it came to the interpreter's test, the check. The Chamber is well aware of this, you know. Was this a person who worked for us? A very wide network of military commanders and veterans was used. There is a sense of urgency, which was also built up. Defence was, of course, responsible for transferring Afghan interpreters and staff who met the requirements of that time. I think that urgency was certainly felt by the staff, the military planners, the KMar and the carriers. The result was an evacuation of a group of 500 Afghan interpreters and other Afghan employees, including nuclear families, who were transferred to the Netherlands. I have also spoken about this with people involved. I experience a great deal of involvement with them. We have seen a real increase in the number of applications during that period. The Chamber has, of course, discussed in detail what happened after that. I'm about to come up with what we can do right now. As is well known, the interpretation system is not limited, let me just say. So even now, people can sign up for that. That's just the way it's gonna stay. I thought Mr Boswijk asked how we deal with harrowing cases. I would like to endorse what Mr Hoekstra has just said about this. He also stressed that we are fully in line with what Mr Knapen said in the debate last October. He then explained that distressing cases cannot be included in a regulation, precisely because you want to create that exception and cannot limit it. So you have to be able to make an individual assessment. Mr Hoekstra said the same thing. This is therefore a space to be used in individual cases. Of course, you should always be reluctant to discuss individual cases in the Chamber. I can give you an example more generally. We've been wondering how we could deal with some of the Afghan army's female gender specialists. They were not formally employed by the Netherlands, but the Netherlands did give them training and collaborated with them. That is why I decided that they should be eligible for transfer. In the case of any person requesting a transfer, the greatest care must always be taken to determine whether he or she is eligible. As a result, Mrs Piri asked about Afghan family members who are now active in the Dutch armed forces. That's true, of course, because there are people working in the Defense Department with an Afghan origin. In some cases, of course, it is very hard for them to have family members who are not part of their nuclear family and who are still in Afghanistan. We have said that you cannot actually make a general exception for that, because then you should, of course, do so for many other groups as well. But in specific cases it is possible and therefore you must want to assess it on a case-by-case basis, at least when it comes to adding these people to the active transfer scheme. Of course, it doesn't apply if they came to the Netherlands in another way. Then I come to the lessons learned, the evacuation and Mrs Belhaj's question. It has already been reported to the Chamber that we are working on improvements to the crisis plan. We are doing this on the basis of Mrs Belhaj's motion. It means that a lot has to be done. It means that evacuation plans had to be updated in several countries, including Iraq and Mali. That's what happened. It means that the administration of local staff in missions had to be updated. This must be done retroactively on the basis of the mission archives available. I can inform the Chamber that it has been completed for Iraq and that Mali is now being worked on. After that, this should apply to new missions every time. The CDS, the Commander of the Armed Forces, has ordered that the local staff be registered in missions. That's the usual way now, because that's how it's supposed to be. But in these missions we have put things in order retroactively and on the basis of what is in the archives. And in the case of Mali, it's still going on. That's a separate question, but I'll let him answer it. It also looks at solving existing problems in the field of strategic air transport. Mr Stoffer pointed that out. That is a very valid point, which has already been recognised by the previous cabinet. The previous cabinet decided three years ago to replace the C-130s earlier. That was something that was only planned for eight years, but that was brought all the way forward then, so that the new devices can also become available earlier. But that is not enough, because of course it will take time. These devices must be ordered, purchased, made and delivered. That's gonna take time, but that replacement project is running. That is important and so it is much sooner than originally foreseen. At the same time, we also want to ensure by buying extra hours that we can have more capacity when you need that capacity. The point is that you actually need some sort of guaranteed basic capacity that you can use any moment in crisis conditions. So in the future we should actually have a combination of sufficient own capacity, available for very special circumstances, conditions that can occur at any time. We also need more capacity, but we can do that by doing what we already do: pool and share with others. That's a great system for times when you can plan, because you don't need that capacity very often. If you can plan it well, then it is wise to share it with other countries. But we also need to make sure that our base is in order. So we're gonna do that for now by buying in extra hours. In addition, we are replacing the current fleet of transport aircraft.",True,0.026,0.88,0.094,0.9982,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-13,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 67, Session 13 (2022-03-31)",2022-03-31,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 13,Meeting 67,Sitting 2022-03-31,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,3

That's very important. But the context of this is, of course, wider.

I am very positive about such initiatives. I really applaud it.

That's what I'm happy to say. Mr. Chairman. Then there is a question from Mr Ceder. Are there any people on the evacuation list that we know have been captured or died in any way? Unfortunately, in one case, it is known that an employee who has worked for an international military police mission has indeed died. In general, we know that it is. We no longer have contact with a number of applicants. It's tried with some regularity, but it doesn't work. Since, as the Chamber knows, we no longer have people in Afghanistan to actually conduct research and make physical contact there, it will stop there, although we cannot, of course, draw any conclusions. They're people who are registered, and we can't determine what's going on with them. That is the information I can give to the Chamber on that point. Finally. A few comments were made on the security situation in Afghanistan. Mr Hoekstra has already said something about it. Of course, there is no major conflict in Afghanistan anymore, but there are violent incidents, there is small-scale resistance. The Taliban are, of course, trying to crush that. We know the ISKP, the Islamic State Khorasan Province, who commit weekly attacks in Afghanistan. The Taliban are carrying out operations against that again. So it is far from quiet and safe, quite the contrary. Then there is the National Resistance Front, which is being repressively addressed by the Taliban.

I have great respect and appreciation for the way he leads his country in this war and the way he and the Ukrainians fight for their country, their freedom and their future. We continue to condemn Russia's invasion and war crimes with the most powerful terms. Wherever possible, the Netherlands should help to prosecute those responsible for these crimes legally. Through the tragedy with MH17 we know the consequences of Russia's aggression. In the aftermath of this, Ukraine supported us. As far as the VVD is concerned, we must continue to support Ukraine with humanitarian aid, financial aid and military goods. Ukraine demands more and heavier weapons. Is the Netherlands willing to continue to supply them and work creatively with other allies? I'd like a response from the Minister to this. At the same time, we must continue to put pressure on Russia. What steps does the government take to enforce sanctions more effectively, for example by detecting real estate and financial flows? And aren't there any unwanted holes in the current sanction packages? Or can we exclude Russian investment even more, for example, from European procurement and in the energy sector, especially in the case of nuclear energy? Mr. Chairman. The last few days there's been hope for a tipping point. Russia seems to have abandoned the intake of Kiev and seems to be prepared to make concessions, especially in relation to the towering demands at the start of the war. At the same time, there is a risk that Russia will only relocate troops for the reinforced offensive in Eastern Ukraine. How's the minister looking at this? After the last few months, there is an important lesson for the VVD: words from Russia are worth little. It's really about action. Finally. The war in Ukraine is more at stake. It is about the freedom and security of Europe and about the values and principles in our future world order.

He is brave and has achieved something Putin never expected: a Ukraine with a national self-consciousness. Let us hope that a process of negotiation offers a way out of this terrible war. I want to make two points. The commitment of this struggle is freedom. Freedom of information is essential. The EU has banned the activity of Russia Today. This transmitter, which is of course very pro-Russian, has a low viewing density. Russia has banned Western media channels such as Facebook, BBC, Deutsche Welle and Radio Free Europe. For example, Russian citizens, especially young people, were cut off from important information channels. Now all they have left is state propaganda. My question to the Minister is: was the closing of information channels, albeit in retrospect, wise? Second. The Netherlands is at the cradle of international law. In times of war, humanitarian war law must limit military violence and violence, precisely in order to protect civilians, children, wounded and prisoners of war. This area is covered by Geneva Conventions. There is a humanitarian war law platform in the Netherlands. War crimes soldiers must not be allowed to go free. The Hague has been the seat of the International Criminal Court since 2002, which operates on the basis of the Rome Statute of 1998.

The Ukrainian President addressed us as Europeans who share the same values they have been fighting for for weeks: freedom, democracy, tolerance and respect. As part of the European family, Ukraine deserves every support. Volt is therefore also in favour of granting Ukraine candidate membership, so that it can be guaranteed funding and additional support for the democratic reconstruction of the country after the war. As the President said, our EU membership depends on you. I am also very pleased with the motion that Mr Sjoerdsma has just tabled. As far as military support is concerned, Zelensky is asking for more stingers to be delivered. Can the Minister undertake to do so? But Zelensky is also asking for heavier sanctions to be imposed.

193,ParlaMint-NL_2022-03-31-tweedekamer-4.u39,"Thank you, Mr President. I've heard Zelensky speak several times. I have also heard the Foreign Minister Kuleba speak several times in European gremia and in NATO-Gremia. But again today it was extremely impressive to hear him talk about what is going on in his country, how heartbreaking that is and how terrible it is what we see passing through the media. But at the same time, it's admirable. It is admirable how the government and the people there are willing to literally put everything at risk to defend their country. It has made a great impression on me, on the cabinet and, as I see it, on the Chamber, to hear him say that again here in the Chamber. It was very impressive. Let me speak for how I am doing, but I believe that this also applies to many of us here. This means that every time you ask yourself the question: what more can we do and how can we do more in the areas of arms, diplomacy, humanitarian aid, refugee reception, economic support and sanctions? How can you help him, his government and his people, precisely because they are literally fighting for their lives, but also for the stability, peace and security of our entire continent? So again, it was very, very impressive. Let that also be an appeal to us when it comes to showing that same determination and maintaining unity in Europe and within NATO. Mr. Chairman. I will answer the various questions as best I can. Of course, I am doing this together with the Minister of Defence, who will, in particular, be responsible for the military part. Mr. Chairman. I start with everything that has to do with diplomacy and, in good Dutch, accountability, and with the legal side. I believe it was the VVD and the SP who specifically asked: what about the negotiations in Istanbul? In any case, Mr Van Dijk asked, but I think Mrs Kamminga and perhaps others too. Let me say something about that in general, because it has something rather uncomfortable. I deliberately choose not to comment on the various pieces that come to us in the Chamber and in the media. I do, because I want to keep things from floating... Things have been floating in the media for a long time. Sometimes this is obvious from the Russian side, but sometimes it is done by others. If we, as well as others, were to comment and say'maybe so', we would run the risk of potentially sanctioning some of these things and of affecting the negotiations in a negative way. Our mission is, of course, to do the utmost to make Ukraine's position at the negotiating table as strong as possible. My observation is that at least two things are needed for this from the Netherlands and from the West. It is very simple in such a negotiation: the stronger you stand on the battlefield, the stronger you stand at the negotiating table. The Secretary of Defense will say more about it in a moment. That means that we, together with a lot of countries, are also trying to see that more widely in the diplomatic contacts I have, realize that we must continue to supply weapons and that we must not let ourselves be tempted to think that we should stop doing so, because we are talking about them now. It is exactly the other way around: the stronger on the battlefield, the stronger at the negotiating table. Then the second. At such a negotiating table we know that too, fortunately in a completely different context, in the interior............................................................................................................................................. Those sanctions do hurt, don't they? So continuing with sanctions and ensuring that we hit Putin's entourage and Russia, is potentially helping Ukraine's position at the negotiating table. Not only do I say that, but so does my colleague Kuleba. It is therefore a somewhat long answer to Mr Van Dijk's question. I understand his question about Istanbul very well. Once again, I am in contact with a number of colleagues, particularly from Israel, but I also have a lot of contact with my colleague from Turkey and from Ukraine itself. Of course, I am also in contact with the larger countries that follow all of this and that can occasionally think along with it. But I am actually trying to point it out as little as possible, regardless of the fact that we, the Netherlands, are also very clearly committed to that diplomatic trail. Of course, we want to give it a maximum chance, as long as Ukraine is not forced to say yes to something later, where it is actually turning in all kinds of things that one should not have to turn in in any way. Mr. Chairman. I take advantage of Mr Van Dijk's question to add one more notion. I think it is important to say that here too. I said this earlier this week in the media and perhaps in one of the committees, but I would like to emphasise this here. It cannot be that if Ukraine comes to an agreement, hopefully under good conditions, then we as the West will automatically say: and now everything is forgiven and forgotten. For then thousands of victims have been killed, billions have been damaged, international law has been trampled underfoot and everything we stand for when it comes to the rule of law has just been pushed aside by Putin and his entourage. So now I can't predict how we'll proceed. Then too, unity in Europe and with our friends and friends in North America and Great Britain is of great importance, but it is true that we will have to talk again about how we are going to relate to Russia. I would just like to say this, with apologies to Mr Van Dijk for using him as a coat rack for this somewhat longer presentation. Mrs. Mulder asked about the evidence collection. We very much advocated that. We also support the ICC's investigation. We have indicated that we co-finance the OHCHR research committee. This also means that there is a strong evidence mandate, partly thanks to the Netherlands. We will continue to make every effort to do so. Mr Eppink asked with a very nice wording: shouldn't the law frame power? Absolutely. It is not for nothing that the Netherlands is one of the countries, also given our position and our limited format, which for decades have been largely reliant on law, international law. That is exactly what needs to be done here; no peace without justice. So on the track that we are using through the ICC, the International Court of Justice, that committee of inquiry, that's all essential, we're definitely going on. Mr Ceder asked: are we dealing with other countries too? Absolutely. I always mention this point in the bilateral contacts I have. Of course, everyone in the ministry does so and so do all ambassadors. But I was in Slovakia and the Czech Republic yesterday. This is, of course, about the various aspects of the war, but that is what I call very explicit: the war will soon be over, but then we must have already started collecting evidence. Because we will have to ensure that those who have done so are held responsible for this. Mr. Chairman. Perhaps one last comment in the category of diplomacy. The great challenge in this conflict, but also in everything that is going to bring about this conflict, will be that we, as a country, as a Union and with our North American partners, work on the following. It is about continuing to articulate the need to act against this, but also about the great importance of democracy, the rule of law and the respect of everyone's borders. We must do so in the direction of the 141 voters in the United Nations. 'Cause, yeah, there's a group that's just as hard on it as we are on it. But there's also a soft underbelly in it. There is also a group of countries that could potentially become wobbly, especially if this kind of thing lasts longer. And then there is the diplomatic challenge to talk to the 35 countries that have chosen not to condemn this, but to take an intermediate position, for their miraculous reasons. That is precisely where we need to engage in dialogue, to explain to them that it is ultimately in their interests and in the interests of the world community that we condemn this, and that this is a litmus test of the credibility of the way in which the international community operates. Mr. Chairman.

195,ParlaMint-NL_2022-04-13-tweedekamer-6.u12,"Thank you, Mr President. Finally, there is the Security Test Investment, Mergers and Acquisitions Act. It has taken a long time for him to be discussed in this way in the Chamber. The law protects vital companies and sensitive technology against enemy countries. For us it is a good law with an important purpose, but it is a complex law, as I have just heard Mr Van Haga say. That is why I would like to be the first to thank the officials for the very useful technical briefing. Many of the questions that my group has been struggling with have been answered. That's why I can keep it a little shorter today. Mr. Chairman. I told you before: the creation of this law goes back years, even before my time in this Chamber, when there were discussions at KPN and PostNL. But since then, the problem has not got any worse. We also see it again in the war between Ukraine and Russia. At the same time as that terrible war with weapons there is also a digital war taking place to inform, to infrastructure used to communicate. And although this is less visible, it is no less disruptive. Mr. Chairman. We need to protect our vital companies and sensitive technology. In D66's view, this law is a good means of guaranteeing that strategic autonomy, something that Mr Amhaouch of the CDA has often called attention to. My group therefore supports this proposal. But during the technical briefing we also discussed the question: how does this law work in companies with different parts, where part is sensitive and part is not? I am thinking, for example, of a campus, where we have a lot of it in the Netherlands, but Eindhoven is perhaps the most famous example. As spokesman for innovation, I have been able to visit many of these campuses. What happens there is innovative and inspiring, and is also attractive to foreign investors. Mr Van Haga just referred to it. We also need to ensure that those investors stay here to invest in those innovations. I understood during the technical briefing that the part of the campus that concerns, for example, a laboratory is covered by this law, but companies without a laboratory, i.e. not necessarily bound to the building, are not. This is precisely where a campus structure is very important in order to protect these companies. I therefore ask the Minister: how do we ensure that the entire ecosystem of companies is protected? Mr. Chairman. Then I'm going to go to technological developments and adjust criteria. The technique does not stand still. There are a lot of technological developments, fortunately, but this can make technology that is not yet characterised as sensitive more sensitive. My group therefore welcomes the fact that the so-called scope of application of this law can be adapted by means of a general measure of governance. I therefore ask the Minister: how does the Minister investigate what new techniques that exist should be identified as potentially sensitive? How is the Chamber informed of any intention or decision to use a general measure of governance to characterize a technique as sensitive? I would specifically like to draw attention to companies in the start-up or scale-up phase, which are not yet vital or sensitive, but which can be. Mr President, I will conclude. The Netherlands needs to be strategically autonomous. To do so, we need to protect our vital processes and sensitive technology.

196,ParlaMint-NL_2022-04-19-eerstekamer-6.u563,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to be standing here with you tonight. This is my first time, my scoop, in the Senate. That is, of course, a special moment. It's also a hundredth day, I understand. I didn't know it myself, but Mr Schalk just recalled it. The age difference has become clear, because what we were talking about was grandpa's and grandma's, in this context, really about my children who are of this age. Nevertheless, I am very pleased to be here. Mr. Chairman. I've identified four cubes. I'm trying to keep it short and concise. I'm going to give you a few facts and figures very briefly. Then I will say something about vaccination policy. Communication is the third block. Finally, there are the other questions. First of all, what exactly is the situation with the facts and figures? It has already been discussed in the debate, but I would like to make it quite clear. I've got it right here, too. When it comes to the birth cohorts, we did indeed see a falling line until 2016. Then my predecessor wrote a rather alarming letter, further with vaccination, and also made a number of choices to tighten up the vaccination programme, the RVP. That's what happened then. At that time, the proposal for an own-initiative act was also tabled. Now it actually comes together. There really was an urgency, because you saw that falling trend. At that time, we were lucky to see that trend recovered somewhat. In the middle of the covid situation we are indeed seeing a slight deterioration of 1 to 2 percentage points. I would also like to point out that this slight deterioration is indeed a deterioration, and at the same time a relative deterioration in the European perspective. If you look at how the Dutch RVP did it compared to the rest of Europe, fortunately it has been quite good. At the same time, I would also like to say that the figures are below the WHO level of 95%. This therefore calls for a firm and alert attitude towards this programme. So we will also have to continue with the RVP and increase the vaccination rate. That is what I would like to say in a general sense, to indicate what we are doing now. You can continue to fill that out yourself. Then I have one more question in this block about clustering. In this respect, the cabinet initially said, at the time of the first appreciation of the bill, that there might be a cluster risk. The RIVM then said: that may not be the case. The reasoning behind this is that RIVM states that, in particular, the national vaccination rate ultimately determines the risk of an outbreak at a location, and the specific vaccination rate at locations to a lesser extent. So what RIVM is saying about that potentially increased risk of cluster contamination is actually a nuance to the government's first appreciation. Then I go to my second block, namely vaccination policy. I'm just going to answer some of the questions for a second. The VVD had a question about this. She said: the WHO is actually calling for vaccination to be brought to the highest possible level and to actively combat the falling trend. I very much agree with that. I've already turned that in. My predecessor also said about this urgent downward trend: we really need to get to work on this. He introduced the action plan Further with vaccination. I am going to elaborate on this before the summer. I am going to look into how we can also strengthen this action plan with the current facts. There are all kinds of wonderful examples of how to do that best, but for the summer I will come to the House of Representatives, and if you wish of course also to the House of Representatives, with an explanation of how that action plan will be further strengthened. There was also a question about D66, namely: what does the government intend to keep that vaccination rate high? I told you, quite a firm policy has been put in place. There is still a great deal going on in this area, including an invitation to provide additional information, to send repeat calls, to check contact moments and to see if there are still open vaccinations. All this is done within the framework of the 1 or 2 percentage points lower presence around the covid vaccinations of the other National vaccination programme. GroenLinks asked to zoom in on different groups, because that might help to get a little more insight into what helps within which group. I'm just gonna get two groups out of it anyway. That's the vaccination rate of people in the Biblebelt. The second is residents of specific neighbourhoods in the major cities. Interestingly enough I can also share something about both groups from my own experience. I'm not gonna do all of that, but I think I can point it out a little bit. First of all, the Biblebelt. We can see that the jgz has made a number of additional interventions here too. In Barneveld, for example, a standard conversation is offered about vaccinations. The results are actually very positive. Almost all parents visit the consultation. The first experience is that the consultation is highly appreciated, gives a lot of knowledge to parents about vaccination that they did not have and removes incorrect information. This is an example of how we address this particular issue. Another target group is, of course, the people in the specific neighbourhoods in the big cities. What we're doing there is basically working with key figures. Neighborhoods in The Hague and Utrecht have made very specific and targeted choices: extra time for professionals to engage in conversation with parents, after calling parents, because very often it is not an active, but an inactive choice, and sometimes also on the spot vaccinate during home visits. Mr Ganzevoort also asked: is there any reason to doubt the policy in view of the progress of the vaccination rate? I should like to say the following. If you look at the impact of the primary choices that have been made around continuing to vaccinate, we are lucky to see that the vaccination rate increased during the same period. I am careful to say that this is directly related to each other. Because there are so many autonomous effects that we cannot link them all to. I would therefore like to reply in particular: it is still a very urgent matter to be constantly working to increase the vaccination rate. He is still not at the safe level, at the 95% of the WHO. In short, there is still work to be done. But fortunately, the declining trend has been slightly reversed. That was badly needed, otherwise we might have come under 90%. Mrs Vos asked: is it not better or safer to use other measures than those through childcare? I would just like to say one thing about this, namely that the greatest safety we can offer children is ultimately the overall vaccination rate. That is ultimately the factor that leads to the most security. That is what the cabinet is committed to as much as possible. Then I move on to the third block, namely the vaccination communication.",True,0.042,0.829,0.129,0.9989,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-04-19-eerstekamer-6,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 26, Session 6 (2022-04-19)",2022-04-19,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 6,Meeting 26,Sitting 2022-04-19,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,CU,ChristenUnie,Coalition,Centre-right,MaartenVanOoijen,"van Oijen, Maarten",M,1990,32.0,False,4

198,ParlaMint-NL_2022-04-21-tweedekamer-9.u6,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There are two words in politics that are sometimes totally misappreciated: ""turn"" and ""be consistent."" ""Roaring"" always has a somewhat negative tone and ""consequential"" is often seen as something positive. Only, recent events have shown that sometimes things can be different. For example, GroenLinks' colleagues and the PvdA recently came up with the idea of spending 2.1 billion less on the armed forces, but as soon as the war broke out in Ukraine, they made a turn. They stepped over their shadows and became a warm advocate for more investment. In that respect, I think it's very nice to see you step over your shadow, that you see that you've made a wrong assessment and that you're turning. But there are also parties that are still consistent. They were always before cutting back on our armed forces, and they still are now. For them, I brought a quote from Von Clausewitz. When I translate it to current events, it reads as follows: ""Even Putin is a lover of peace. He would have preferred to have taken Ukraine without resistance."" I very much hope that these parties, which are still consistent, will also make the move in the near future. Mr. Chairman. During the debate, I drew attention, among other things, to bureaucracy. Spending more money on defence is very important, but it is also the bureaucracy that sometimes kills everything when it comes to procurement. My colleague Valstar will therefore table a motion.

201,ParlaMint-NL_2022-04-21-tweedekamer-9.u16,"Yes. I think it is very good that Mr Hammelburg marks the stages in the war. That is, I think, whatever is going on, and whatever has been said today by President Biden, and whatever Zelensky is always emphasising. We've had the first phase. The second phase has begun, but there is still a phase behind it. And it is true that not only the Netherlands, but also many other countries are happy to provide Ukraine with what they need for the current phase, but indeed for the next stage. And nobody knows exactly what it's gonna look like. No one knows exactly how long this is going to take, but we have to bear in mind that that next phase is coming. That is why it makes sense to provide heavier equipment, even if that means that it is not immediately available for now, but it enables Ukraine to seriously prepare for the next stage; whether it is a war phase or a phase in which it simply needs deterrent. Mr. Chairman. First of all, I will go to the Hammelburg/Boswijk motion on part No. 65. It is actually about European cooperation, about the specialities that the Netherlands has; and of course the other countries have, but we are committed to doing so. We can't do everything on our own. Fortunately, we do not have to, because we are embedded in NATO and the EU, and that cooperation is our strength. We would like to continue with that, and we would like to give Chamber of Appeal to this first motion. The second motion, the one in part No. 66, is about the MQ-9 Reaperdrones and their possible armament, in the interests of legal frameworks. I understand the motion very well. I would like to propose to the Chamber, or rather to the petitioner, that is how it works. There's a report from the International Affairs Advisory Council. There's still a cabinet response to that. It's about this. It is about autonomous weapons systems, partly autonomous weapons systems, and the importance of the human actions that must always be there. The cabinet is coming up with a response. I would suggest to the House that the motion be retained until it has been able to take note of that reaction. We're working very hard, including the Defence Note. Of course, this will also have to deal with these issues, and with the weapons of the drones at all.

Thank you for continuing the main debate in this way. If one thing has become clear, then the task of building a military force that is even more flexible and agile has only become more clear in recent weeks around the Ukraine crisis. The discussions we have had with each other in the main debate and also a number of motions that have now been tabled call for this to be done even more. So thank you in advance for that. I shall proceed to the appreciation of the motions, Madam President. I'll start with the motion in part No. 67 on service law. This is the opinion of the Court of Justice. That's not for nothing. We're already working on it. We have talked about this, of course, during the main debate and last week with the launch of the campaign, which I hope will appeal to all of you. Share that campaign, I'd say. Talk to your neighborhood about it. Share it on your social media with your many followers. It is really important that we connect thousands of people to us and that we scale up when it comes to the Defence College or, for example, the years of service. Think of classes and veterans for the class, for example, as the petitioner himself indicated. They're all good ideas. Thank you for your support. We're gonna keep doing what we're doing. This motion will help, so I'll give you the motion in part number. 67 Judgment Room. Then I come to the motion on part No. 68, tabled by Mr Goudswaard of JA21. I also say to him: thank you for the support in the back. The coalition agreement has provided an additional 500 million to get to work on what you say in the motion, so I see this as also underlining the ambitions as expressed in the coalition agreement. We're busy with the unions. We're having good conversations about that. I really hope to be able to come up with beautiful white smoke in the not too long term, which is seen as a good signal because a negotiated agreement has been reached, which hopefully we will not be able to do; we are just going to do so until that substantial improvement in salaries comes. So judge Chamber for the motion in part No. 68. Then I come to the motion on part No. 70 on the acceleration of purchases of equipment and other items. We have already had a good exchange of views on this in the main debate. It is also nice to be stimulated by you here, not just the pilot we are now carrying out around the purchase of ammunition... It is very important to make pace, especially with rising prices, and to supplement our ammunition stocks for the various main tasks.

206,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-10-tweedekamer-33.u208,"No. The information we have is that it is no longer being modified. Because the state of play for the economy of 2020 and 2021 is closed. Then I have an immediate answer to Mr Van Dijck's question. How big is the team working on the HVP? The HRP programme management consists of 9.5 fte. This is similar to countries like Belgium, Austria and Sweden. Then there was a question, or perhaps a suggestion, of Mr Van der Lee. He asked if it was the intention of the Chamber to table motions on individual projects. It's up to you. If you would like to give accents, we will welcome them. Mrs Van Dijk asked why the input for the plan on behalf of Parliament was so weakly taken up by the cabinet, that is what Mrs Van Dijk said? How much room is there for change? I have actually already appointed the room for change in my debate with Mr Van der Lee. I read again that the official inventory with promising already budgeted measures was shared with your Chamber by my predecessor on 1 November 2021, as well as all the pieces that were on the table for formation at that time. There was also a committee debate on 17 November last year. Of course, we are a long time ahead, but there is also a preliminary route. Then I would like to answer a question from Mr Grinwis about the railway construction projects, such as the Lely line. He asked if they could come back to the plan; perhaps that was a comment from Mr Nijboer. It was also about flying, so mobility. Why doesn't railroad construction, like the Lely line, come back into the plan? In the draft plan, the measure European Rail Traffic Management System ( ERTMS) is referred to as ""the European Rail Traffic Management System'. This replaces the current analogue train protection system with the European digital standard. We are of course interested in rail investment, which has already been appointed by some of you in view of the fact that they contribute to the 37% climate investment required. ERTMS is particularly interesting, given the digital component that contributes to the 20% factor for digital investment and its European character. Mr Nijboer asked about the flight discussion and international train traffic in the Netherlands. He says, ""That is hopelessly behind. Why isn't such a plan in it?"" Mr Nijboer just mentioned that. We have therefore chosen to include the ERTMS. This is also a measure that is important for digitaler rail traffic and making rail traffic more future-proof. But I can hear what Mr Nijboer is saying. Without track you can do digitally what you want, but there is still a railway line to be built. I'll take that. Next to Mrs Van Dijk's broader question on digital and education: are funds from the fund going to technical education? Strengthening the digital skills of the future Dutch workforce is indeed part of the measures contained in this draft plan. A few measures will ensure that this is done. It's called ""devices and internet connection."" I don't quite know why it's Dutch and English, but okay. Students are equipped with digital devices and AiNed, as I have just mentioned. To this end, the capacity of training on artificial intelligence is increased. I will come back to Mr Nijboer's question as to why only the National Education Lab is being looked at. The concept focuses more on education, such as measures to combat learning loss due to school closures during the corona pandemic. This may also reflect Mr Van Dijck's comments. These measures contribute, in the spirit of the HVF, to a resilient education during and after the corona pandemic. But I repeat what I said earlier: this cabinet is doing a lot more investment in education. Mr Van Dijck had a number of questions about taxes and purchasing power. Mr Alkaya had questions about the VAT rate, about the flight tax and another question. I would like to start with Mr Alkaya: has it been considered that the VAT rate for public transport should be set at 0%, as provided for in the VAT Directive? The Secretary of State for Taxation and Tax has promised your Chamber that he will come forward with a letter on how to deal with the VAT tariff directive. You'll get this letter in a few weeks. So I cannot anticipate that, but I hope you will be able to wait for this. I also know that you have asked Parliament questions on this issue. You also asked if the Cabinet was prepared to make the flight tax fairer by also allowing transferrs to pay a higher tax under this plan. This isn't the cabinet's plan. In the current design of the flight tax, the Netherlands, like other countries with a tax on flights, has excluded switching agents, partly because otherwise Dutch airports would have a significant competitive disadvantage compared to foreign airports. Are we willing to investigate whether every Dutchman can fly once a year without a flight tax? I have been advised that the non-taxation of the first flight or the higher taxation of subsequent flights is not feasible, because the flight tax is a tax paid by airports per flight movement. There is no record of passengers and how often they fly.",True,0.029,0.893,0.078,0.9902,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-05-10-tweedekamer-33,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 77, Session 33 (2022-05-10)",2022-05-10,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 33,Meeting 77,Sitting 2022-05-10,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,SigridKaag,"Kaag, Sigrid",F,1961,61.0,True,5

One is really about the coverage and the other is about how you support people who have little resources to pay good internet. So it's two things. But I will take them into the investigation that Mrs Van Dijk is asking for. Then there was Mr Stoffer's question about what SMEs are going to notice about the plan. Some of them have already been answered by the Minister of Finance. It has already indicated that in some parts of the plan that are now included there is also room for SMEs, but it is not very widely distributed. I think you have a point to make. At least it's very specific; I need to put it better. It is about accelerating artificial intelligence and promoting education and talent programs. Quantum is all about specific knowledge. For hybrid heat pumps, to mention a different subject, and for example for solar boilers, SMEs can make direct use of the subsidy covered by the plan. It is also true, of course, that the coalition agreement has made a much wider reference to the position of SMEs and that other debates are also taking place on this issue. Hopefully, reinforcement will be generated for innovation and sustainability, for example. There are many subsidies, but the question is: are they enough to help SMEs take those steps? So we're looking at that critically. We want to do it as best we can. Then I come to Mrs van der Plas' questions, first of all about... Now she's not here; that's sad. The first question was about thezzp'ers. I know they're at SZW investigating the position ofzzp'ers. I will pass on Mrs van der Plas' question to the fellow minister.

208,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-17-tweedekamer-22.u29,"Mr. Chairman. There was something to do last week about a maiden speech. Then I saw that this debate was coming and I thought: I can actually get my maiden speech back from four years ago, because it was also about abuses in slaughterhouses. I told them I was a butcher's girl when I was 15. I can tell you all one more time now, because most of the committee members are new. Mr Graus was there, and Mr De Groot, but for the rest, new Members of Parliament have all come to this committee. I told them I hit my head against the carcasses in the cooler if I had to grab something. And I said I hated holding a tongue when I had to cut tongue, because then you felt those papillates and you felt it was really an animal. I also said that I had started eating less and less meat, a development that many Dutch people are going through. I must also say honestly that, because of the debates we have had here in the Chamber, I do not actually eat meat at all, because it is so horrible. That also illustrates the story of Mrs. Vestering of just now. At the end of my maiden speech, I expressed the hope that this debate would not be repeated. Many motions have been adopted in recent years, and since this problem is discussed here time and time again and there is a great deal of support for animal welfare, you would say that it is being resolved. But nothing could be further from the truth. There seems to be some kind of system in the way the ministers of LNV deal with adopted motions here in the Chamber. A motion to improve animal welfare in abattoirs is said first of all: hold that motion for a resolution. There are a lot of Members of Parliament who put the motion to the vote. That motion will then be passed. The Minister then refers to EU legislation that is still to come. Then we get a letter saying that it is not legally possible what we want. Then the minister will ask the industry to arrange it himself, or the minister will do research, or the minister will prepare a bill for a long time. In the last letter we received from the Minister, he stressed that a great deal had been done and that a great deal had been done. But it has not yet produced any results, because we are now here to talk again about the abuses in the abattoirs. I would like to mention two aspects. The first aspect is the tire speed. A motion for a resolution has also been adopted on this subject. The tire speed should be reduced as soon as possible, but the Minister sees no legal possibilities. That's always the answer. You would say: then you create a legal possibility as a minister. Because we can make laws here. Ministers can make laws and regulate them. But no, the Minister is going to investigate the effects of lowering the slaughter rate, while we in the Chamber have said that the tire speed should be reduced. There's gonna be a practice test. We didn't ask for that as a room either. The Minister says that a supported review framework is needed to assess whether there is support for the measures. Then I ask the Minister: support from whom? At the abattoirs or at the Lower House? The conclusion is therefore that there has been no impact of all these efforts on the Ministry on the issue of the speed of the band, because it has not changed and we are back here again. The second aspect is camera surveillance, which has been mentioned before. There'll be a law on that. That's very good. Many motions have been passed on this in the past: in 2014, twelve motions in 2017, in 2018, in 2019, in 2020 and three motions in 2021. The biggest piece in the letter on the Camera Surveillance Act is about the deployment of artificial intelligence. I would say to the Minister: don't make things so complicated; just make sure there's a law that says there's camera surveillance and make sure that camera surveillance is made public, so that everyone can watch what's going on in the slaughterhouse.",True,0.058,0.848,0.095,0.9826,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-05-17-tweedekamer-22,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 80, Session 22 (2022-05-17)",2022-05-17,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 22,Meeting 80,Sitting 2022-05-17,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,GL,GroenLinks,Opposition,Centre-left to left,LauraBromet,"Bromet, Laura",F,1970,52.0,True,5
209,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-17-tweedekamer-22.u127,"Thank you, Mr President. A large number of questions have been asked to me. I'm standing here on behalf of the cabinet. I must confess that, when I said yes to the request to become Minister of Agriculture, I did not expect to have this debate with your Chamber. So, Mrs Bromet, I too must say that I personally am not looking forward to this kind of debate with the Chamber. I do not think that this issue is important, but I actually think that society should have solved it, so that a debate in the Chamber is not necessary. But it is true that slaughterhouses are regularly the subject of discussion and criticism. Let me be absolutely clear: I think this should not be necessary; I think that animal welfare is incredibly important. I am also saying this towards Mr Graus. It is not just about animal welfare in the sense of looking at animals and keeping animals. No, it's also about animal welfare at the end of these animals' lives. I believe that every effort must be made to ensure this. It must not be the case that the economy is first in terms of animal welfare. Efficiency and production must not be at the expense of animal welfare and food safety. Animals must be treated with respect. As far as I am concerned, responsibility for animal welfare and food safety lies primarily with the companies themselves, whether they are the primary sector, the transporters or the processing industry. It's the responsibility of every link in that chain. If there are abuses there, we must appeal to them as well. That means that I too will certainly take steps in my position, if necessary. I'm not going to stand by and watch any wrongdoing. Fortunately, we have an organization for this, the NVWA, which is very conscientiously engaged in its task and mission. In recent years there have been discussions about the NVWA. This also has to do with the fact that there were problems with staffing. Luckily, your room has decided to make extra money available for that. Fortunately, I am working with the ig of the NVWA to see how we can improve it, how we can ensure that there are more people and that conditions improve. I think that is a very good thing and that we can also take some serious steps. It is also clear that it is not all 100% here and now. The Chamber also said it's human work. It's still human work. Of course it is, but I do believe that we have a responsibility to enable that whole chain to deal with it in a good and responsible way. I say it again: that means that I will see to it, on behalf of your Chamber, that there is good action. Of course we're not done. Much has been going on in recent years. I've heard your room a number of times about the situation around Gosschalk. That was a shocking situation. I'm glad my minister has decided to lock the door there. I also note that considerable steps have been taken there. That is where steps have been taken which, however,'satisfaction' is not the right word to convey a slightly positive vote on me when it comes to taking responsibility. And yes, it was too late; certainly too late. Because that's where things happened that couldn't stand the light. I've seen the footage, too. That's where things happened that weren't justified. Things are happening, and I have also talked about this with Pigs in Emergency, who cannot, which cannot be tolerated. I think we should see to that together. I'm sure I will. That means we're not at the end yet. That means, for the development of camera surveillance, I will be there in a moment to answer the questions that we are going to use much more firmly on that camera surveillance and on artificial intelligence. A large number of you mentioned the speed of slaughter, the practical test and the establishment of a framework for assessment. I'm working on it. I watch very closely for what can and cannot be done. But not every company is the same and not every situation is the same. Every once in a while, we have to be tailor-made, and we have to take care of that customization. NVWA needs tools to improve supervision even more. I will work very hard for that in the coming period. The position of the Netherlands in Europe is not that of an island; no, that is a position that... Well, if you ask me about my ambitions, that is that we will be among the top predecessors when it comes to the treatment of animals and animal welfare, also on the road to slaughter. That is what I intend to do in the Vught Group, a merger of countries that consider animal welfare to be of great importance, not only in long-distance transports of animals, but also in slaughterhouses and when they are on their way to a slaughterhouse. In this respect, therefore, I have a firm ambition to take steps in the coming years.",True,0.037,0.821,0.142,0.9984,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-05-17-tweedekamer-22,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 80, Session 22 (2022-05-17)",2022-05-17,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 22,Meeting 80,Sitting 2022-05-17,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CU,ChristenUnie,Coalition,Centre-right,HenkStaghouwer,"Staghouwer, Henk",M,1962,60.0,False,5

I am perfectly clear and clear: I have ambitions in this area. That has nothing to do with delay or other matters. I would like to serve your Chamber with the right proposals, which are legally sound and feasible; that is, of course, also a point. I just need time for that, and that has nothing to do with delay. Mr. Chairman. A large number of questions have been asked on the subject of camera surveillance. Once again, I think that surveillance should be introduced. That's not a discussion. I also think that camera surveillance should be as technical as possible, so artificial intelligence should really be a part of that. It is still in full development. It means a lot. It must also be legally well-protected, justified. I just need a little time to do that. I have told you that I have great ambitions, but sometimes time leaves me in the lurch. This has simply to do with consequences such as internet consultation, as a discussion in the Council of Ministers, as a notification to the European Commission and as consultation and advice from the Council of State. I've got something to do with that. I am not saying that this is so annoying, but it is, of course, the consequences of procedures that we have agreed on in the Netherlands. I say to you, even from this chair, that I'm going to speed up where I can. Camera surveillance needs to be established, camera surveillance in a broad sense. I think if you have a company that has nothing to hide, you should just allow camera surveillance. And yes, it must be justified. It's about people who work there.

We need to talk to each other about artificial intelligence, about aligning systems, about how to deal with the law on privacy, about the Archive Act, the guidelines and therefore very concrete about how to deal with text messages. All this deserves serious attention. As the President of the WRR said, it may not be a sexy subject, but it does touch on the core of our democratic rule of law.

219,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-25-tweedekamer-11.u31,"Madam President. We have made our objections to this amended referendum law known in detail in the first term. The referendum is a wonderful starting point: giving people a binding voice in new laws. They may say no to certain proposals. But the party cartel did two mean tricks with that. Firstly, the result of the vote must be so high that it is almost impossible in practice. Between 100% and 130% of the turnout should vote against if you have an average turnout, so that's going to be very difficult. The second is that all kinds of issues are also excluded from that referendum. Nevertheless, we have said that we are going to present it to our Members. Our members have spoken and we, at the Forum for Democracy, do make binding statements by our members, to binding referendums. We are therefore following with conviction the majority of our Members. They have said in a digital member referendum with more than 55% that they want to give this flawed referendum a chance in the end. We're just gonna try. We're gonna vote for it. At the same time, we are going to work to improve it and to come up with proposals for improvement. We are going to try to make a flawed referendum grow step by step towards a real referendum. I have a number of motions to try to give this form right away, but I would like to start by saying that we are going to vote in favour. Why are we so sceptical about this non-binding? That's actually very good to explain with two pictures. This is the picture of the 2005 results. Almost two thirds of the Dutch population voted against a European constitution. The Treaty of Lisbon is the same as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Communities. The Dutch population has therefore been completely ignored. You can actually say that it was silenced, but it is after she was allowed to speak first. Secondly, in 2016 there was a referendum on the Association Treaty with Ukraine. Oh, how right the Dutch people were. We are now seeing what this stupid approach to Ukraine has led to and what a fateful war that has resulted in. Of course, the Ukrainians will be the terrible tragic victims of this. But what had the Dutch people seen well at the time and how terrible it was how that was handled, also here, with Rutte and his insert sheet. None of that was true. This association agreement has simply come about, bringing Ukraine closer to the EU, to the trade part, but also to the military part, which we now see every day. So you can not only see that the Dutch people are ignored; you can also see that the Dutch people are right over and over again. So that is why we are so in favour of these referendums and hope that they will eventually become binding. Maybe the messenger can hand out these pictures in memory of the members of the cartel, because it can't be shown often enough.

220,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-31-eerstekamer-11.u2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Council of Europe's report on the Dutch rule of law offers a useful external view. The impression is that the Netherlands is generally a well-functioning state with strong democratic institutions and guarantees of the rule of law. We should be grateful to note that. At the same time, not everything has been said. Several spokesmen have put their finger on this too. The report rightly reveals a number of problems, including the legislative process, for example when it comes to realistic expectations of the results. I see a government that has an ideal image of the citizen. This ideal citizen is proactive, independent, rational, entrepreneurial, linguistic, able to evaluate the financial and legal consequences of his own actions and to solve problems as much as possible himself. With such a citizen, there can be savings in ggz and youth care, access to public services can be digital as much as possible, and the use of algorithms within public systems is not a problem either, because with such an ideal image, this does not easily lead to problems. However, the ideal image is too rosy. Parliament must also be keen on this. Legislation on the donor law or the bill for the abolition of the period of reflection on abortion shall be based on the self-employed, autonomous citizen who has and has every opportunity to make a rational choice that suits his or her situation. Unfortunately, reality is often different. In the recommendations of the report I noticed that the emphasis was placed on the feasibility of legislation and that it should be based on fair, realistic assessments. Legislation should not be in line with fiction. Mr. Chairman. There also seems to be an ideal image of society: a multi-faceted society in which everyone has the freedom to have and to express their opinion. But do we still dare to talk fundamentally about norms and values, about conflicting conceptions of life? Can there also be room for a critical opinion, based on the Bible, even if it deviates from what the majority thinks? It is no longer an exception in Western countries that citizens and even politicians are brought to justice because they quote from the Bible. Regular reports are made because a biblical view on sexuality is found offensive. Think of the case against the Finnish Member of Parliament Räsänen, Reverend Latzel from Bremen, Reverend Kort in our own country. How does the Minister assess these examples? Is this not a worrying trend with regard to both freedom of religion and freedom of expression?

221,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-31-eerstekamer-11.u56,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Speaking on behalf of the D66 Group, I will concentrate on three issues. But the main idea is: be careful of the rule of law. You will not be surprised by that main idea after what has been said about it this morning. So be careful of the rule of law. But I would add: be careful of the democratic rule of law. If anyone has just pointed this out to us, it is the Russian President Putin, who invaded his neighbour, which is now causing a war in Europe that we could not imagine. This is not just about territory and military power, but also about autocracy and democracy, about autocracy against the democratic rule of law. So there really is something at stake for the Netherlands. The three topics that I will be discussing are the financing of the legal chain, the continuity of legal protection and the legislation as a key activity. I'll start with the first topic. In this Chamber, we have, year after year, expressed concerns about the inadequate financing of the legal chain, and in particular of the case law. In almost every state-of-the-right-state debate, we have called for additional funding and pointed out the capacity problems and the rising workload. Interventions on digitalisation have largely failed, while Registrys have already been scaled down. From this Chamber there has also been an attempt to stop the cutting off of the social lawyer and, contrary to that, to carry out precisely the advice of the Van der Meer Committee. To be honest, it has not always been very successful in recent years. Money has been added to the public prosecutor's office and to the investigation, but it is forgotten that for the vast majority of citizens the case-law begins with the canton court. The vast majority of cases are canton courts, family law and legal entities: civil matters. Of course, the reinforcement of the State's Attorney's Office didn't make much sense. There's been a toga protest, we've had appeals from the profession, critical judges... anyway. We've had the Rosenmöller motion. We have not been able to achieve very much. Fortunately, however, the new cabinet has realised that, although it sounds contradictory, it is necessary to use money to save on the rule of law; it is necessary to provide additional funding for the rule of law. In the coalition agreement of the Rutte IV cabinet, a different tone finally sounds. The downward trend we have seen for years in which justice was actually the closing point has been reversed. There was also butter with the fish. This has been mentioned a number of times, by Mr Rombouts and Mrs De Blécourt. There is also additional coverage, occasional, but also structural. Anyway, one swallow doesn't make a summer. So we all want to see it happen. I look very closely at the Minister of Justice. We also have our blessings, because we have been able to achieve them in the right direction. We met the Secretary of State for Asylum in another field, Mr Van der Burg. He is not here now, but we have seen a different tone in the debate there too. That too is a tone for us in which the human dignity and humanitarian aspects of this difficult task have been given a place for him. Mr. Chairman. Of course, the premium affair could not remain unnamed. It has been discussed a number of times and has pointed out to us how alert and how sparing we will have to be on this case law and on the rule of law in all its parts. The President-in-Office of the Council also referred to this in his annual report for the last year. In the Venice Commission's report, it is still interesting when foreign observers look at your country and then we see that not everything is equally beautiful, but that the final conclusion is hopeful. We can work on that. There are concrete points of improvement and, of course, a low point has been noted; we have already talked about this. I think we have been able to set a low point these days, namely that there has been institutional racism in the Tax Administration. Speaking of the rule of law, the State is of course the first to maintain it in its own implementation organisation.",True,0.062,0.842,0.096,0.9766,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-05-31-eerstekamer-11,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 31, Session 11 (2022-05-31)",2022-05-31,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 11,Meeting 31,Sitting 2022-05-31,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,JorisBacker,"Backer, Joris",M,1953,69.0,False,5
222,ParlaMint-NL_2022-05-31-eerstekamer-3.u33,"Okay, so this was about truth in times of progressive digitisation, because the truth doesn't exist. But you can surround her. Much depends on interpretation and perception. Some of the facts are still to be established. The soil under our rule of law, the solid ground under our legal feet, is very often still to establish the relevant facts. Almost every sentence begins with it. The bourgeois stand, the Cadaster, the notary, they all exist by the pardon of facts. Artificial intelligence has recently come to the point that fictional texts can be written as if they were of an authority. Graphic footage will soon be indistinguishable from real for an expert. Last week we saw an example of such a deep-fake movie, but you can also make such a video and very soon of even better quality if you are looking for a close alibi. A forged digital signature on a deed or other contract is increasingly difficult to distinguish from a real one. Add to this that more and more legal traffic takes place digitally. How do we guard the soil under our rule of law, the fact-finding? Is the government aware of this threat and if so, what has it done to identify this threat? Is the government also in talks with other parties, such as information specialists and notaries? It is precisely the notarial profession that has traditionally stood for the authenticity of documents and the reliability of registers. Is the government talking to this profession about how they shape their core tasks in current and foreseeable digital developments, for example by validating the different data flows of interest to the rule of law? In general: is the Dutch rule of law prepared for increasingly difficult distinctions between real and false? Are authorities involved in the rule of law sufficiently capable of verifying the authenticity of digital sources? It is also important to accept acts and judgments from other EU countries without their own examination. That is why the question of how well this is regulated within the EU is also raised. Mr. Chairman. Finally, a piece on the press, which is addressed in particular to the Secretary of State. An independent and diverse press is another vital condition for the functioning of our democratic rule of law. Here is the same problem, which is what facts are, even more pregnant. Digital developments make it increasingly easier to present credible alternative ""facts"" and keep alternative readings out of the field of view. This makes traditional media party in the debate and makes them vulnerable. This makes it possible for growing groups of people to confront each other about the underlying facts and not about their interpretation. Was there even corona? Does Earth even warm up? In the previous speech we heard that question being asked here. Is there any war in Ukraine? Nothing is as old as the manipulation of news facts, but now it is happening on a scale and a manner that has not been shown before. This also undermines the functioning of the rule of law, for example because the judge is no longer accepted as the last speaker, for example by refusing to accept election results. My group realizes that public intervention in the content of news is undesirable. However, the public authorities can create conditions in which this independent, pluralistic news provision is realised and widely known, including local and regional ones. Perhaps even juíst local and regional, because here the balding and thus the threat to the functioning of the rule of law is greatest. In its report on Local Media, the Culture Council has set out how much money should be added annually, including in order to maintain the legal value of local media. The government has more resources than direct funding. For example, it can also impose a tax on the largest recipients of advertising revenue. These are digital platforms like Facebook. The funds could then directly benefit the regional media. Is the government prepared to investigate possibilities for this? Mr. Chairman. As far as the Kingdom is concerned, I agree with what Mr Karimi said, in particular with regard to the settlement of disputes and the functioning of treaties. Then I'll come to a conclusion. The state of the rule of law is bad on an important part. He doesn't protect everyone equally. In fact, he protects the good people better than the people who deserve protection. The child allowance scandal was a pregnant example of this. Our rule of law is also threatened by digital developments in determining the facts and displaying independent and pluralistic news, especially locally. On the other hand, there is a cautious improvement in the state of the rule of law as regards the attitude and action of the public authorities and the courts in the area of administrative law. My group hopes that this government will take structural measures to strengthen the state of the rule of law in the long term. This prevents a mop-up course from incident to incident and it is the legitimacy of this debate. I am therefore very curious about the answers.

As a result, it is also one completed story in which different topics are interrelated. That is why I would ask my colleagues to put them at the end if there are any interruptions. At least that way I can finish my finished story. Mr. Chairman. We are talking today about the rule of law and therefore the state of law. Law and civilisation are inextricably linked. The historian Hans Goedkoop reminded us of this in his moving lecture during the commemoration on 4 May in De Nieuwe Kerk. He brought us back to Bergen-Belsen and to Abel Herzberg. This Jewish lawyer organized a court of law in that Nazi camp that bowed to evil done by the prisoners in the camp: stealing a loaf of bread, a fight.

He quoted Abel Herzberg: ""The first sentence of human civilization: the recognition that there is something that is allowed and something that is not allowed."" Yeah, that's right. Human civilization presupposes an ethical consciousness. It's good to keep thinking about that, even here in our work as a senator. What we call the general awareness of the law, in which we consider the general principles of law, presupposes an ethical awareness in each of our communities. This brings us to the state of law and thus to the rule of law. Our sense of justice not only came into sight on 4 May, the day we thought about what a state of lawlessness would bring about. A few weeks earlier atrocities of Russian soldiers came into view. We heard shocking stories about an evil that we hadn't felt close in so long. In the report of 18 May last, the Human Rights Watch Human Rights Organisation concluded that Russia has systematically committed war crimes. On the same day, a first trial began in Kiev against a Russian soldier who shot an innocent civilian. That 21-year-old soldier was sentenced to life imprisonment a week ago. The first sentence of human civilization will always ring in the application of law. Shooting a civilian, no matter how young the perpetrator is, however brainwashed the commanders, how deluded by disinformation: a civilized man with an ethical consciousness does not escape to count his own act to evil. Mr. Chairman. Historian Hans Goedkoop told us something important on 4 May, and I quote him: ""If man does not see his own evil, how do you hold on to what is allowed and not allowed?"" That is indeed a fundamental task for the guardians of the rule of law: bring your own evil, even if it was in the past, into the picture and explaining, accountability in terms of law. A right consciousness evolves. After the first sentence of civilization, many other sentences will come. This leads to constantly new moral challenges and a growing awareness of good and evil. Such a task is that in the past we must consider action by the Dutch State which we reject today from the point of view of ethics and law, in terms of law, i.e. injustice. It is precisely with this recognition that we support our present awareness of good and evil and recognise the rule of law's foundations. That is why, in the previous debate on the rule of law, I also suggested that a law should be introduced in which the past of slavery should still be regarded as a crime against humanity. The setting-up of the working party on self-evaluation in connection with the premium case, a subject which is the subject of today's debate, also reflects the recognition of the moral duty to examine the extent to which earlier action had lost sight of the ethical compass. Mr. Chairman. A rule of law that develops as a state of law needs not only lawyers, but also the knowledge, skill and commitment of historians who expose evil. On 17 February of this year, the evil that we have done in Indonesia was prominently depicted. On that day, researchers from the NIOD and the other institutions involved presented the report Over the Border, a report on extreme violence in the Indonesian Independence War, from '45 to '49. That publication and the broadcast of the presentation of the report were a historic event, a step that says something about the development of our current Dutch rule of law. A few years earlier, on 1 October 2019, the judiciary also demonstrated the strength of our general awareness of the law. In the civil cases of the victims of the crimes of Captain Westerling's special forces, the State relied on the civil limitation period. The Hague Court found this unacceptable in law, but the court went even further. It also made a trip to the criminal statute of limitations. By law of 8 April 1971, which ruled out an action for limitation of crimes against humanity, fear was not made an explicit exception for the crimes committed by the Dutch military during the period '45-'50. The Court noted with interest that that decision had been based on political considerations, considerations which should no longer be accepted according to the state of the current general awareness of the law, as laid down in international agreements. Another expression of civilisation, courtesy of the judge, who here corrected an unethical political decision. This left the question open as to whether the rejection by the judiciary in 2012 of a request for criminal prosecution of the military would have been legally correct. That rejection was based on the law of 8 April 1971 which was contrary to the general principles of law and treaties. Mr. Chairman. Historians and lawyers therefore endorsed the responsibility of our current rule of law for the evil that has been committed in the past, as revealed in the Cross-border report. That was about evil that was going on about 70 years earlier, so quite recently. Mr. Chairman. Exactly 100 years ago, Hendrikus Colijn took over the leadership of the Anti-Revolutionary Party. Soon after, he became Minister of Finance and then led four Cabinets as Prime Minister. That was from 1933 to 1939. 40 years earlier, this politician had started a military career in Indonesia. He played an important role in the Aceh War and during the so-called Lombok expedition. He was later even rewarded with the Military Willems-Orde. It is bestowed on excellent deeds of courage, policy and loyalty. A young lieutenant participating in that Lombok expedition wrote a letter to his loved one. This was about the battle he fought as commanding officer on Lombok at that time with a rebellious population, men and women who resisted the Dutch army armed with spears and cheeks. Mr. Chairman. I quote from his letter. ""I have seen one who with a child of about six months on the left arm and a long lance in the right hand came at us. A bullet from us killed mother and child. We were no longer allowed to give mercy. I had to put nine women and three children who asked for mercy on a pile and leave them to die like that. It was unpleasant work, but it had to be done. The soldiers rain on their bayonets with pleasure."" The woman to whom he had sent his letter wrote in the margin: how terrible. ""How terrible"": it seems that women are needed to assess events such as these from a human point of view or position. Mr. Chairman. This lieutenant, who wrote his loved one about his crimes, later became Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Yes, President, Ministers, Secretary of State and fellow senators: the letter I read was from Hendrikus Colijn. This letter is in the archive of the Historical Documentation Centre for Dutch Protestantism. I have a scan of the passage in question with me here. Mr. Chairman. Just before the outbreak of the Second World War and the extermination of innocent people that we commemorated on 4 May, our rule of law was led by a Prime Minister who had nine Balinese women and three children slaughtered for mercy. What does this say about our rule of law? What does it say that the massacres and colonial submission of Indonesia in the last century were officially referred to as ""ethical politics,"" as ""the ethical direction in colonial politics""? Mr. Chairman. Today's debate is also about disinformation. Here we see a historical sample of that. The nothing-gentle with gruesome massacre subjects of a population was formulated as an ethical task. After all, it was about ""civilizing"" a population in a colony conquered by the Netherlands to raise it to a western civilization. The ""how terrible"" that Colijn's wife uttered when she read his letter has more to do with upliftment. That awareness of good and evil was already there and could be pronounced, but as long as it was only noted in the margin and disinformation and propaganda about government massacres were presented as ""ethical necessity,"" civilization disappeared from the picture. Mr. Chairman. Civilisation and our concern for the rule of law require that we face the evil that Colijn participated in, even though it was more than a century ago, historical investigations and judgment in terms of law. If ""the first sentence of human civilisation"" is the basis for condemning crimes against humanity, as committed by the young Russian soldier, should this not apply to a condemnation of crimes committed under the guise of ""ethical politics"" more than a century ago in Aceh and Lombok, also led by someone who was previously honored with the Military Willems-Orde and became the Prime Minister of our country? Mr. Chairman. Half a century after Colijn's crimes, the Dutch rule of law re-established its home in Indonesia. Now it was not about colonial conquest, but about a spasmodic struggle for the preservation of the colony and the ruthless suppression of a struggle for freedom. It has taken too long for such a large group of historians, at the request of the government, to be able to deal so thoroughly with the systematic extreme violence in Indonesia. What came up with the report on crossing the border recently will have made a deep impression on all of us here. Mr. Chairman. Just before the presentation of the study of NIOD and the other institutes, a book by the lawyer Maurice Swirc was published entitled ""The Indian cover-up"" and entitled ""Why Dutch war crimes in Indonesia have never been prosecuted."" The title 'The East Indian cover-up' would have been even more appropriate, because if one thing became clear from the contents of that book, it would be that the Dutch Government knew that Westernerling, I quote from the book 'had been guilty of unacceptable action'. The latter is a literal quote by Prime Minister Drees from the Council of Ministers of 29 February 1949. In the same year 1949 a committee of inquiry was formed to investigate the crimes of the Dutch military. This led to a report by the two lawyers Van Rij and Stam that came on the table in 1954 with the Minister of Justice, Minister Donker. Now there was clearly evidence of crimes against humanity, and not just that. My teacher, Professor Guus Belinfante, who at that time was a counsellor at Justice, was asked to examine the report ""on his legal merits with a view to possible criminal proceedings against the persons concerned."" Belinfante's conclusions were explosive. I quote: 'The actions of Westerling and his followers, however well covered by authoritative authorities, lacked any legal basis'. Not only could persecution be brought against Westerling, but also against his superiors and against soldiers and rulers who were once again above them. Belinfante spoke of a ""snowball"" which then continues to roll and warned that ""it will not be possible to escape the role played by the civil authorities."" Mr. Chairman. In today's debate on the rule of law, we are also talking about open government. The reports of Van Rij and Stam and the findings of Council Advisor Belinfante and Council Advisor Kazemier, who shared his views, were withheld from the Chamber and filed as ""very secret."" The Council of Ministers chose the cover-up and voted in a majority against prosecution. What the government knew was silenced. Shouldn't the lid be completely open, as it suits a civilized rule of law? Aren't there still pieces of secret or limited access? Mr. Chairman. Back to Hans Goedkoop: ""If man does not see his own evil, how do you hold on to what may and may not?"" For this debate on the rule of law, I interpret this creed in this way. It is precisely in order to anchor our ethical principles and the general awareness of the law that it is necessary for legal experts to determine whether the military action of the Netherlands in Indonesia during the period covered by the report on the border was punishable. The same applies to the extent to which officials of the Dutch State have contributed to this. The historians of NIOD deliberately chose not to give a legal assessment. So there's an invitation for the lawyers. We must take them up as guardians of the rule of law. What about the so-called India-refusals, citizens who were excluded from the duty of attendance or soldiers who deserted? Were they not actually on the right side of history after the report on the border? Mr. Chairman. In the 4 May speech by Hans Goedkoop, I also feel that the question is whether we in this so-called gifted country still have the pointy compass that he talked about. We can talk about the premium affair, about losing sight of the human dimension, about an even wider ""how terrible"" than that of Colijn's wife. At the heart of all this is the question: has our rule of law not lost sight of man himself? Didn't the money replace our ethical compass? Do we still think only in terms of having instead of being? Has ethics disappeared in politics? Hans Goedkoop also encounters such questions at the end of his speech. In the context of sanctions against Russia, everyone with a reasonable compass for good and evil raised the question of how ethical it is that the Netherlands acts as a tax haven and facilitates financial structures for unsavory figures from equally unsavory regimes. In our so-called gift country, we were seeking, as Goedkoop puts it in relation to Russian kleptocrates, to ""create a pleasant location climate for the money of that aggressor, which we already knew at that time was the thief's money."" Mr. Chairman. There is a ghost throughout Europe, especially through our country: a ghost who speaks right which is crooked. Not most of the votes apply, but most of the votes apply. The rich enrich themselves, while poverty increases dramatically. Isn't it time for an ethical reveil? For some, this term has a bad smell, which is associated for them with dated Christian-democratic politics, but what is against bringing civilization closer again, rediscovering our ethical compass, throwing away the blind power of money and propaganda about that gifted country and returning to the most basic ethical principles in which our right is rooted? At the expert meeting, everyone agreed that the implementation of law in a rule of law should lead to the allocation of their own. Indeed, a fundamental principle of law. This requires a return to one's own ethical compass for anyone who participates in the rule of law. Our party also involves the position of animals in ""everyone's."" No one's gonna be surprised. The VOC mentality from imperialism has moved from humanity to animal kingdom. What does an ethical reveil do with the ambition of our gift country to be the biggest butcher and milkman in the world, for which 600 million animals are slaughtered every year in our country after a short and miserable life without any moral compass? Speaking of disinformation, where the current legislation talks about veterinary interventions, it appears that it is not about healing, but about mutilating animals. The articles of law are about powers to cut down tails, removing horns, filing of fangs and so on; everything to facilitate the keeping of animals in stables. As the concept of ""ethical colonial politics"" obscured the criminal nature of massacres among the Indonesian population, the mutilation of animals in the business-economic interest is now proposed as medicine. How awful! The ""how terrible"" must reconnect with our sense of justice. The task will be to identify where moral obligations should be included in the field of legal obligations. That is a difficult task when we see what is happening in the world at the moment. Mr. Chairman. The number of people affected by food shortages has increased in two years from 136 million to 276 million. The rise in food prices will benefit billionaires in the food and energy sectors. Their assets increase every day by 600 million dollars. During the pandemic 62 new billionaires joined the food sector, while 263 million people fell into poverty. And I am not even talking about the millions of climate refugees and victims of our free trade agreements, which put less developed economies at an even greater disadvantage. Mr. Chairman. In crimes against humanity, we think of shooting soldiers. But anyone who thinks in terms of an ethical reveil sees that an ethical duty to give each one their own must extend, including to those millions of victims of poverty and water and food shortages. Doing nothing feels ethically criminal. Those who turn their eyes away from obvious injustice make themselves morally guilty of such injustice. In the context of the state of law and the rule of law, the question then arises as to whether doing nothing can also be regarded as ""criminal"" in terms of law. That is an important question for those who uphold the rule of law, that is to say for the ministers, the rulers, and for us as senators. Mr. Chairman. I will conclude with a few clear questions. Does the Minister agree with me that, assuming that the facts correspond to what Hendrikus Colijn writes to his wife about his struggle at Lombok, it must be established that a future Prime Minister of the Netherlands has committed a crime against humanity? Is the government prepared to withdraw the granted Willemsorder? Are all government records relating to the Dutch acts of war in Indonesia in the period covered by the report Over de Beroep now publicly accessible? If not, is the government prepared to achieve that accessibility? Is the Minister prepared to set up a committee of authoritative lawyers to assess, on the basis of the facts available to date, whether Captain Westerling, his subordinates and his superiors were guilty of crimes during military action? Is the Minister prepared to take steps to grant legal reparations to the conscript military who were convicted of refusing service or desertion committed between 15 August 1945 and 31 December 1949? Does not the behavior of these Indians and deserters justify praise rather than punishment, because they were on the right side of history? Following a criminal complaint lodged on 12 January 2012 by Pondaag concerning crimes committed by Dutch military forces, it was then decided not to prosecute with an appeal for limitation. Does the Minister agree with me that a criminal limitation period has been wrongly invoked? Does the Minister agree with me that by keeping the report of Van Rij and Stam secret and failing to inform the Chamber of the content of Belinfante's and Kazemier's opinions on the criminality of Westerling's actions, the government has acted unlawfully against those who have committed such acts and has also violated the constitutional obligation to inform Parliament? Finally. Can the Minister reflect on the extent to which facilitating the use of Dutch legislation by a group internationally referred to as kleptocrates contributes to the undermining of the legal order? If the Minister shares that view, is the Minister prepared to make a plan of action to criminalise the opening of letterbox companies that facilitate this? All the way to the end. Can the Minister reflect on whether a duty to take measures to counter the food crisis and to tackle super rich people, not only as a moral but also as a legal obligation, should be considered? If that is the case, can the Minister reflect on the time and the way in which that could take shape? Mr. Chairman. I look forward with interest to the answers of the rulers.

228,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-02-tweedekamer-18.u84,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me be clear: the NCTV has to abide by the law. Nor are normative positions on MPs and other people who interfere in the public debate. In an ideal world, in which people share and adhere to our values, we don't need agencies like the NCTV. But the world is not ideal. Threats also come from different sides in the Netherlands. Based on the NCTV threat picture, we know that the most acute threat against the Netherlands comes from the corner of jihadism, extreme right-wing and anti-government extremists. This makes the existence and work of the NCTV necessary in an open society. Social media are also used to attack our open society. To defend our open society, the NCTV is therefore urgently needed. Among other things, they have the task of analysing phenomena and trends, for example in order to support municipalities in the wider context of radicalisation. In order to do so, the NCTV should be able to collect and interpret data. The Authority has now stated on 8 July 2021 that the organisation decision JenV cannot serve as a basis for the processing of personal data by the NCTV. As a result, NCTV no longer identifies and indicates these phenomena and trends in the field of threats, which are inextricably linked to expressions and behaviour of persons. The NCTV has also ceased its participation and contribution to local cases. Finally, NCTV has ceased its participation in the Task Force in problematic behaviour and unwanted foreign funding. In the letter of 2 November, the Minister stated that this did not serve the interests of national security. That is why we would have preferred to talk today about the processing of personal data law, a law that should provide a framework for NCTV employees when it comes to processing and acquiring personal data. Hence my questions. When can we expect the note on the basis of the report? To what extent is the Netherlands at risk as a result of suspending parts of the work of the NCTV? To what extent are the possibilities to halt potential attacks in a timely manner now limited? And how can the Minister guarantee that the threat level of 3 is right if it is not based on as much information as could be obtained before the suspension in 2021? Mr. Chairman. The world is rough, and it's getting rougher. Our values seem to be less and less accepted. If you want to fight this well, we believe that three things are very important. Firstly, that is sufficient capacity. Current circumstances call for the strengthening and strengthening of the capacity for international detection and judicial cooperation at European level. The coalition agreement provides an impetus for this. Secondly, we are dealing with appropriate legislation focusing on the possibilities of new detection methods. Information processing increasingly requires staff from the services. The CDA has previously called for more attention to be paid to new detection methods such as financial data analysis and artificial intelligence. This includes knowledge of laws and regulations. Thirdly, it is a question of focusing on ethical action. Laws are often lagging behind when it comes to technical possibilities and information exchange. An ethical framework will then provide an opportunity for action. How does the Minister view the idea of paying more attention to new detection methods such as financial data analysis and artificial intelligence in the training of employees?

Mr Slootweg asked what I think of the idea of giving more attention to new detection methods, such as financial data analysis and artificial intelligence, during the training of employees. Apart from the foundations and the powers, I can say that it is always good if our people are also well trained throughout JenV, at the NCTV and everywhere in the security domain and can be well aware of the new developments. 'Cause if you don't, you're always 10 steps behind the criminals. The legislative proposal as it now stands imposes some limitations, precisely on these elements. The bill contains a limitation on the use of technical tools that collect personal data on the basis of profiling. That's not possible. Analyzing, combining; that is all excluded. All this has been included in the proposal. I say very specifically: this means that there is no use, for example, of software designed to profile. So algorithms and the like can't be used. That is also laid down in the law, and that is, for example, a very good thing that I would like to keep in that law. So it's important that people are always up-to-date, including in terms of their development and their education. The question is whether this always fits perfectly with what the NCTV should be able to do at that time. Mr Slootweg also had a question about privacy and ethics. Yes, there is ample attention to privacy and ethics within the curriculum of the NCTV Academy. This is, of course, something that must be constantly evolving and constantly evolving. The NCTV also has a privacy team, which is committed to raising the awareness of privacy laws and regulations among employees. I have already said that this has, of course, been a highly developed domain in recent years.

231,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-3.u2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The ambition of the coalition agreement to play a leading role in the European Union is not a moment too early. The European continent is once again the battlefield of a bloody war. The State of the European Union, recently sent by this Minister to Parliament 2022, further explains where we can expect a leading role of Rutte IV. The Netherlands wants the EU to become more effective, economically stronger, greener and safer. According to the Dutch government, a leading role of the Netherlands is not only appropriate, but also necessary. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance agrees with the core of the government's EU policy, but in the context of today's world, this phrase needs to be thoroughly concrete, and I want to talk about this today. Firstly, an effective EU. Three and a half months old is Russia's latest military aggression. Unfortunately, after initial agreement on sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine and its people, the EU is increasingly revealing its divisions. ""In Brussels the veto rules again,"" headlined the NRC last Saturday. Spokesmanship was lost in the decision-making process on the sixth sanction package. After weeks, a partial oil embargo against Russia was not yet definitive with the notorious cross-ligger Orbán about his forced exemption position for Hungary, or he successfully demanded that the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Kirill, who provided Putin's war with religious legitimacy be removed. How does the government appreciate the EU's ability to act at the moment? Orbán's success over the last few weeks is poignant. A more effective EU requires, in the first instance, internal cohesion. For years, violations of the rule of law in Hungary have been tolerated, Orbán has been ruled out and the Article 7 procedure has not been taken seriously. How does the Minister view the decision-making mechanisms in this context within the EU and what reforms does he propose in the future to make the EU more effective? How does the government assess the European Commission's decision to make available EUR 36 billion from the Corona Restoration Fund to Poland, the other Member State with a critical track record on the rule of law? To a country which disputes the primacy of European law and undermines independent justice by means of political appointments of judges. This half-heartedness in dealing with EU values, such as a strong rule of law and democracy, and the safeguarding of fundamental rights and freedoms, is evidence of a lack of EU capacity in our view. This also affects the EU's credibility. What is the leading role of the Netherlands in protecting these values in the EU? Does the government share the position of the President of the European Commission that, because of the reception of many tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees and arms supplies to Ukraine, Poland is an important partner in the fight against Putin's aggression, and that it is therefore better not to deny Poland the funds from the Corona Restoration Fund? Or does the government share the position of Mr Timmermans and my group, among others, that the European Commission is the guardian of the European treaties and should not be able to negotiate with the rulings of the European Court, but should be firmly behind the basic rules of a democratic rule of law? Is the government prepared to speak against this in the Council? If necessary, I shall consider tabling a motion on this matter. Although Poland has announced that it will abolish the disciplinary court before the judges, the independence of the judges has still not been restored. There is currently a penalty payment of EUR 1 million per day for Poland imposed by the Court of Justice on violations of the rule of law. What will the Dutch Government do to ensure that the judgment of the Court is enforced? Mr. Chairman. As far as the reception of refugees is concerned, Poland is a two-faced country. Poland's hospitality towards the refugees from Ukraine is very commendable, but it does not prevent Poland from violating human rights at its borders with Belarus and sending refugees back to Belarus by force from further afield. What does the EU actually reward here? A racist refugee policy? I'd like a response from the Minister. The EU's approach to migrants and refugees at its external borders is important for an effective EU in its external actions. The world is fully aware of how the EU does appeal to other countries for human rights violations, but it is itself that tramples on its borders. During the debate on the rule of law in the EU, I drew attention to the violations of human rights at the EU's external borders, to the pushbacks by, among other things, Greece and Poland and the role of the Frontex in them. In the meantime, the Director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, has left, partly as a result of the European Parliament's efforts to put an end to abuses in this organisation. My question to the Minister is once again what leadership role can we expect from the Netherlands to put an end to the continuing violations of human rights of refugees at the EU's external borders. In short, what is the leadership role of the government in ensuring the internal cohesion of the European value community so that its credibility and effectiveness, and thus its ability to act, can be guaranteed? Mr. Chairman. Secondly, safer EU. In the terrible war on Ukraine's territory, the armed forces and the people of Ukraine resist Russian aggression and Putin's war crimes. In parallel, there is an economic war in which the West and the EU are directly involved. The Western and EU sanctions policy against Russia, on the one hand, and the stop on gas supplies to some EU countries and the suppression of Ukraine's grain exports by Russia, on the other, have unleashed a true world-wide economic war. The poorest part of the world is paying the highest price for this economic war: high energy and food prices, high inflation and a threatening famine. A long-term economic war will disrupt the lives of millions of people worldwide. Let us hope that the economic world war of the moment does not turn into a military one. A peace is more than the absence of war and security is more than just an absence of violence. The economic war that is now under way will not stop until a solution has been found for the war in Ukraine. How does the Dutch government view this? And what position does it take with regard to ending the war? At what cost is this acceptable? Vladimir Putin's Russia is clearly the aggressor with daily gruesome war crimes against the Ukrainian people. According to GroenLinks, it is our duty, the duty of our leaders, to pursue a swift end to this war. Does the government share this position? The safety and well-being of millions of people depend on this. My group believes that it is too quiet on the diplomatic front. Can the Minister share with us what thoughts he and the EU have on the way to ending this war? For the security of the Ukrainian people, it is important that they can count on the prospect of a future within the EU. Can the Minister give ready-made wine in this house about the position of the Dutch Government on Ukraine's accession to the EU? My group agrees that Ukraine must meet all the criteria before it can actually join the EU. At present, it is a question of granting candidate status. Under what conditions does the Dutch Government consider dialogue and cooperation with Russia possible? In the long term, cooperation on the Eurasian continent is desirable for the security of Europe. How does the government see Europe's security structure now and in the long term? Has the position of the Netherlands changed with regard to a European army and European defence structure? And, if so, in what way? What is the leading role of the Netherlands in the debate on strategic autonomy and a European security structure that also integrates Russia? My group would like to hear an explanation of this Minister's views. It is clear that a lasting peace is not possible without justice. The war criminals must be tried. Can the Minister indicate what options are currently being examined for the trial of the gross violation of war law? Mr President, third. Economically stronger and greener. It should not be surprising that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been an economically stronger and greener EU two things that go hand in hand for over 30 years. Unfortunately, it is only now that the coalition parties slowly realize that the costs of doing nothing about climate change are inconceivablely higher than they are now doing. Actually, we're already too late to stop one and a half degrees of global warming. A stronger economy has so far meant above all a union of a single market and a single currency. However, is a social and sustainable EU what EU citizens want and ask for? The agreement reached the last night between the European Parliament led by Agnes Jongerius and the Council on the minimum wage is rightly a breakthrough. We are counting on the Dutch Government to soon translate this directive into national law. I'd like a response. The government is also positive about the Green Deal, and it also wants to be a frontrunner in this area. The ""Fit for 55"" package can also count on its support. Now the question is how hard the government is working to speed up initiatives on energy saving and the roll-out of renewable energy and green hydrogen. It should be clear that new gas extraction or coal-fired power stations are not in line with the ambition to lead the way in climate change. The cabinet also wants to focus on a sustainable food system at national and European level, which is in line with the European Van-Boer-to-Bord strategy. It is interesting to note that, in the government's juice valuation of the European Commission's work programme of November 2021, the cabinet considered that there was no long-term vision for rural areas. In the State of the Union 2022, this point no longer comes back. In the meantime, if there is a long-term vision, I ask the Minister. In addition, the Van-Boer-to-Bord strategy is again under pressure due to food supply problems caused by the war. Mr. Chairman. The great climate crisis, biodiversity crisis and food crisis should motivate us with great ambition to take on board the energy transition and transition in our economic system, which increases social inequality and exhausts the earth. Can the government indicate in concrete terms what initiatives it is taking for a more social and greener Europe in the light of the leading role it intends to take? Mr. Chairman. The world after 24 February is a different one than before. A more effective and economically stronger, greener and safer EU cannot be achieved if the EU continues to operate with the same rules of the game before 24 February. And majority decision-making on European security and foreign policy with the full involvement of the EP is not only inevitable but highly desirable, and treaty change is therefore also desirable. Now that the conference on the future of Europe has ended, what are the government's plans to achieve the desired Treaty change? And what changes does she think of? Mr. Chairman. I'm closing up. A leading role of the Netherlands is indeed appropriate and necessary. Now butter with the fish, please. My group will support the government in achieving this ambition. Show us your actions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",True,0.116,0.738,0.146,0.9935,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 32, Session 3 (2022-06-07)",2022-06-07,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 32,Sitting 2022-06-07,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,GL,GroenLinks,Opposition,Centre-left to left,FarahKarimi,"Karimi, Farah",F,1960,62.0,True,6
232,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-3.u4,"Mr President, thank you. For the first time since the Second World War there has been a brutal conquest war in Europe, with thousands of deadly victims and many millions of displaced persons, including two thirds of Ukrainian children. A war which also carries the risk of escalation of an even greater war. These recent unthinkable events and possible scenarios underline that security in Europe is not self-evident and demonstrate our vulnerability, in Europe and worldwide. While hundreds of people have died every day in the battle in Ukraine as a result of the war, a global energy crisis and a global food crisis have also broken out and Europe is facing a recession at the top of rising inflation. This war is certainly, as many have said, a turning point in history. This therefore calls for new thinking on European security. But looking ahead also requires looking back and learning lessons from the past. Putin's war and the wider threat it poses to the whole of Europe shows that we underestimated the aggression of Russian imperialism, but also that we all failed to achieve a lasting pan-European security architecture after the Cold War. One that would also have provided security for Russia, but also bound by it and could possibly have helped move forward towards a more democratic society. That opportunity was there after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but unfortunately that historic opportunity was missed. Mr. Chairman. First of all, of course, we need a ceasefire as soon as possible, which hopefully will enable negotiations to begin. Mr Karimi has just referred to this. In doing so, Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty should be based on the SP. Returning to the agreements in Minsk II, despite all the missed opportunities in the past, seems to be the most promising option. Does the government agree? Betting on Ukraine's full military victory is naive and dangerous. As the Secretary-General of the United Nations has said, regardless of the outcome of this war, there will only be losers here. Does the Minister share that view? Then the longer-term challenges. How can we ensure that the lasting peace and security on the European continent, which we have not managed to forge after the end of the Cold War, will eventually be possible? How can we make sure it doesn't have to take after another cold war of decades? I'd like a response from the Minister. The achievement of an inclusive European security architecture, which we failed to achieve after the fall of the Berlin Wall, is, on the one hand, inevitable if we want to make sustainable security, peace and progress possible, but, on the other hand, it is impossible for Russia to abuse its military and economic power to impose its will on others. It is possible to make it clear to Moscow that, in the longer term, the return to international law standards, to respect the principles laid down, for example, in the 1990 Paris Charter, is of great importance for the future of Russia as a member of the international community. In particular, international diplomacy will have to play a key role in this. How does the government view initiatives by other countries on the diplomatic front, particularly Italy? Meanwhile, the Russian people are paying an extremely heavy price for the criminal war of the Russian President and his government. Support for opposition forces, human rights organisations and peace groups is therefore very important. Does the Minister agree? What are the consequences of the war and the crisis with Russia for the future of the European Union? Big words are often used here. At the conference on the future of Europe, the Kiev moment was already mentioned, but this was mainly spoken of by federalist politicians who saw in the war an opportunity to push through what they have been advocating for years. That is a united Europe, but not only with a single market and a single currency, but preferably with a single army and the abolition of unanimity in all areas. As far as I'm concerned, this is not the way. It undermines European democracy and weakens the Union only in the long term. How does the Minister view this discussion? Does this government ultimately want to abolish unanimity in all areas? If not, where does he want to keep it? Where's the border? Mr. Chairman. We now hear from this minister that the EU must finally become a geopolitical actor. And we also read it in the so-called Strategic Compass. Of course, the EU must stand for its common values in its common foreign policy. It is good that the EU has now united against Russia and imposed unprecedented harsh sanctions. And yes, you can argue whether it should always be done with complete unanimity in the future. On the other hand, the abolition of the veto could also undermine the legitimacy of decisions, as there would be no consensus and certainly if it meant that smaller countries would be overruled by greater support for the EU as a whole. Does the Minister see these risks with us? The idea of the EU as a geopolitical actor is also about strategic autonomy, a concept that this government has also embraced. When it comes to safeguarding public interests, such as reducing our strategic dependencies in global supply chains, there is something to be said for strategic autonomy. But if it leads to a permanent division of the world into rival economic blocks, we're not for that. Nor does it lead to the formation of the EU as a military power bloc. That is the kind of geopoliticisation of the EU that we can better resist. Does the Minister see these dangers with us? European integration has once started as a peace project. That's brought us a lot of good. My group has therefore been and is reluctant for further and accelerated militarisation of the EU. Is the fact that the EU, unlike the US and China, is not a military force, but a power based on trade and on rights and values, not just its strength? I'd like a response from the Minister. Mr. Chairman. The question of how to proceed with the EU was also raised at the Conference on the Future of Europe, which I was allowed to take part in from the Senate with Mr Oomen. It was presented in advance as a bottom-up process in which citizens would engage in dialogue with each other and with politicians on the renewal of the EU, i.e. the voice of citizens and not just elected politicians. At best, the experiment has succeeded in half. To the frustration and frustration of participating citizens, politicians, especially the European Parliament, often took the lead and sometimes also sent the debate. For example, citizens were sometimes used to legitimise a Brussels political agenda, all through a little transparent and democratic process. This is, in fact, a sign of the problems facing the EU's decision-making process. In the State of the Union of the Government, we read: ""As far as strengthening democratic legitimacy is concerned, the Cabinet considers it important to bring the citizen closer to the Union and to increase support for decisions. But how? How do we really make the EU more democratic? Not through the introduction of a system of spitzen candidate lists in the European elections, as mentioned in this document. The Minister does not really think that this will bring the EU closer to the citizens? In my view, the conference was mostly a missed opportunity, but I would like to hear from the Minister how he looks back at it. It was an opportunity to take real steps towards a more democratic EU, and that remains urgently needed, which does not mean that good proposals have not been made from the civil panels, where hard work has been done. In this way, we have come up with the proposal to waive the unanimity requirement under Article 7, which would allow countries which continue to blunder the rule of law to be deprived of the right to vote. Does the Minister see any chance that such a form will become reality for the coming? Mr. Chairman. The conclusion of the debate on the European rule of law a few months ago was a gloomy one. Honestly, I'm even more gloomy now. While Hungary, known as Russia-friendly, is now in any case confronted with the new MFF rule of law, Poland seems to be starting to dance again. As Mr Karimi has just mentioned when it comes to the Commission, the billions from the Recovery Fund are now being released, at least after what critics see mainly as cosmetic adjustments. I assume the Minister agrees with me that this is an extremely bad thing, but what is he going to do about it? Can he stop this with other countries in the Council? Can the Minister promise that his commitment will be that there will be no euro from the Recovery Fund to Poland until Poland has fully complied with the previous rulings of the European Court of Justice? I believe that the Commission is making a real mistake here and is also doing it politically in a way that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, is not appropriate. We often hear that the war against Ukraine has changed everything, but what should not change is that we in the EU stand firm for the values of the democratic rule of law. And so we must respect them in our own homes, otherwise we will only be weaker in the future. I'd like a response from the Minister. Finally, Mr President. The Conference on the Future of Europe was wrongly called that, because it was not about Europe but about the EU. Europe is still bigger than the EU. As far as the SP Group is concerned, there is no question of a rapid extension of the latter either. The war, however profound, does not change that insight. Nor should the war in Ukraine be a reason to relax the conditions for accession. Does the Minister agree with us? In fact, the lesson of the previous enlargement is that we should not do so until we are sure that countries are ready and before we have the instrument in our hands to act effectively as new Member States in relation to the values of the democratic rule of law. This does not mean that we should not cooperate with European countries outside the EU. It is therefore a good thing that there are other organisations in which this cooperation takes shape. The Foreign Ministers of the Member States of the Council of Europe, which is one of those other organisations, decided on 20 May last to hold a very rare summit in the short term, a summit with the Heads of State or Government of the 46 Member States on the future role of Europe's oldest and largest treaty organisation, which aims to prevent war and promote peace through greater rule of law, human rights and democracy in all Member States.",True,0.111,0.75,0.139,0.9957,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 32, Session 3 (2022-06-07)",2022-06-07,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 32,Sitting 2022-06-07,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,SP,Socialistische Partij,Opposition,Left,BastiaanvanApeldoorn,"van Apeldoorn, Bastiaan",M,1970,52.0,False,6

I think it's always important to give diplomacy a chance. A ceasefire must then be part of that. That's what my call was meant to be. That is why I asked about Italy's initiatives. It's going to be a very difficult process. I will not say, like Henry Kissinger, that Ukraine should give up only part of its territory. That is not up to us either, but we need to negotiate at some point. This war can only eventually get a political solution and not a military one. There is also a certain tension between justice and peace.

234,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u23,"Mr. Chairman. This long-standing shift in geopolitical relations led to the thumping of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Many have rightly responded to this with horror and rejection. We share that horror and rejection. The Strategic Compass of the European Union notes the need to defend the European security order. Germany gave up its courage and last week the Bundestag agreed to the announced 100 billion extra for defence. The Netherlands did not lag behind and approached the NATO 2% standard with the now announced additional resources for defence. Ukraine was supplied weapons from the West, but that is how I ask the government: was the European Union not left behind? Does not the defence of the European security order include Ukraine's holding against the Russian aggressor? While the European Union, as a major economic power, is leading standards, for example, in the field of the environment and food safety, it is very slow and modest when it comes to supplying arms to Ukraine. The Paris-Berlin axis seems to have been replaced by the Washington-Kiev axis. It is clear that support from the United States for the preservation of the European security order has proved indispensable, but Europe could not have done much more, and more quickly, in the field of arms supplies, I ask the government. President Zelensky also addressed the Dutch Parliament, at least the House of Representatives. It is strange that, apart from the President, the other members of this Chamber were not allowed to attend. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine then visited our country, but did not underestimate his disappointment at the attitude of the Dutch Government. This was mainly about Ukraine's membership of the EU. Now the PvdA Group also thinks that this morning we have already talked about the need for a country to join the EU at the time of final negotiations to meet the Copenhagen criteria for accession. The European Court of Auditors has recently underlined the importance of this in its report on the Western Balkans. But we believe that this does not prevent a positive signal now, in the form of the short-term acceptance of candidate membership, the so-called application status. Is the government prepared to send that signal in the short term? And, in order to preserve Europe's unity against Russian threats and Chinese influence, is it not of the utmost importance to allow countries in the Western Balkans that do meet the requirements to join the European Union as soon as possible? What is the government going to do to get the accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania started as soon as possible? Mr. Chairman. The war in Ukraine is also of great importance for the relationship between the European Union and NATO, which has been discussed a number of times today. In March this year the European Union published its Strategic Compass and at the end of this month the NATO Summit will discuss the Strategic Concept in Madrid. Both organisations emphasise that cooperation between the EU and NATO is good. However, there are some questions to be asked about this, for example about the EU's rapidly deployable capacity to deploy up to 5,000 troops. How am I supposed to imagine that? Is this commitment subject to a broader mandate under international law, or does the European Council decide on this commitment? Is this being coordinated with NATO or is it creating a kind of double chain of command? The Defence Note published last week does not say anything about this, except that this EU capacity will be under German leadership in 2025. That's why I'm only asking the Foreign Minister. Another war on the European continent. Russian aggression against a neighbouring country has led Sweden and Finland to apply for NATO membership. It is indeed a turning point when two neutral countries so far ask for this membership. The Netherlands supports the accession of both countries. But has the Dutch Government also taken into account that this will reduce the distance between NATO territory and the Russian Federation? In fact, in Finland there is a 1,300 kilometer long shared border. From a Russian perspective, the border drawn by the Iron Curtain in the middle of Europe has increasingly shifted towards Russia, leading to a greater sense of insecurity. Have such considerations, i.e. that the border is getting closer and closer to Russia, played a role in determining the position on Finland's and Sweden's request? Can such considerations play a role in the discussion on possible membership of Ukraine of NATO, which has already been advocated by some other NATO members? Mr. Chairman. The war in Ukraine is likely to last a long time. All this time, support from the European Union to Ukraine is needed. However, there is a risk of a drop in aid and attention, and Putin would do well to do so. Moreover, the consequences of this war are already felt in the country and in the rest of Europe. Food and energy prices are rising as a result of this war and the sanctions. Is the government prepared to compensate, even in the longer term, for the rise in these prices for those who are unable or barely able to make ends meet, for social reasons, but also to maintain support for humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine? Mr. Chairman. I will dwell briefly on the second issue I wish to raise today: democracy in Europe. Here too, the war in Ukraine plays a catalysing role. The war, like the covid pandemic, has made it clear that, if the European Union is to be a powerful geopolitical player, it must be able to react quickly to events, while the Union has for a long time been focusing almost exclusively on longer-term legislative processes. This has consequences for democracy in Europe. For some time now, the government has been calling for the introduction of qualified majority decisions in the Council, which should replace unanimous decision-making. We agree with that. The problem is that to get there requires unanimity first. How does the government intend to break this deadlock, or is the idea of Mrs Oomen's passerelles a solution to that? The increased importance of taking decisions in the short term has also increased the European Commission's position. The political weight of the European Commission, originally intended as a non-political technocratic broker in the architecture of European institutions, has grown. Does the government share this view? The coalition agreement states that, in order to strengthen democracy, the European Parliament must be able to resign an individual Commissioner. What has the government done, or does it intend to do, to achieve this? Shouldn't the number of Commissioners also be reduced? In the coalition agreement, the cabinet also wanted to improve the system of spitzen candidates, now also known as lead candidates, in European elections, but said it wanted to wait for the European Parliament's initiative. This has now appeared in May, and it is essential that the main candidates, the spitzencandidates, should be able to stand as candidates in all the Member States on lists of the whole of the European Union, so that voters can vote for their favourite candidate for the Presidency of the Commission. Can the government therefore explain the criteria under which it will assess this initiative on those main candidates? What does the government think of a directly elected President of the Commission and EU President, as was recently suggested by Commissioner Schinas, responsible for promoting the European way of life? Finally, Mr President. As important as the European Commission becomes and as much as the influence of the European Parliament is strengthened, the Intergovernmental Council of Ministers and the European Council will for the time being play a major role in the aforementioned European institutional architecture. When citizens identify with politics, they do so first and foremost at national level. That is why it is very important that national governments inform citizens and answer to them about what they take on their behalf at European level. And there's still much to improve. The members of the PvdA Group therefore welcomed the commitment in the State of the Union to send a cabinet letter after the Conference on the Future of Europe in response to the Koole motion adopted last year by this Chamber on the need for a lively, well informed public debate on the European Union and the ambitions of the Netherlands. Last week, that letter appeared. It is a good thing that it says that the cabinet sees it as its task to quote: 'to involve citizens in the European Union by informing them, to actively listen to what the citizens expect of the Union and to create acceptance'. Does the government agree with the members of the PvdA Group that building support can only succeed sustainably if the citizens are informed in a balanced manner about both the pros and the opponents of European cooperation? Can the government promise that this balance will be an important criterion for all activities supported by the government? The letter states that in 2022 €250,000 will be available for citizens' consultations. I hope that these additional resources will not be limited to those citizens' consultations, because the government is right to point out that a public debate calls for a constant effort. Moreover, the general public has not actually heard anything about these citizens' consultations this morning in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe. Citizen consultations may be useful for the government to get ideas, but this is something other than actively and balanced information for citizens. What activities of the government with corresponding resources are aimed at and is not a structural budget item needed instead of a one-off amount in 2022? I am considering tabling a motion on this matter later. The members of the PvdA Group look forward to the Government's response.",True,0.046,0.82,0.135,0.9993,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 32, Session 6 (2022-06-07)",2022-06-07,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 6,Meeting 32,Sitting 2022-06-07,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,PvdA,Partij van de Arbeid,Opposition,Centre-left,RuudKoole,"Koole, Ruud",M,1953,69.0,False,6
235,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u78,"Mr. Chairman. On 22 February I led the Ukrainian MEP Evheniia Kravtchuk in this plenary room. She was here for a study on the role of women in justice, security and peace organisations for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. I told her about the history of our democracy, our rule of law and about our active role in the European Union. She listened and looked at her phone all the time, because she was worried about what was happening in her country. Two days later, in the morning of February 24th, I woke up with apps from Eevheniia about bombing in her own city and the cities of Ukraine. They were apps with footage of Russian bombing. As with colleagues, the war is also a central theme in our contribution to this debate for D66. In the light of that war, on behalf of D66, I would like to place three important objectives for our democratic society at the heart of our story. These are three objectives which we also recognise in the State of the Union. The first is the promise of freedom in union in peace and prosperity. The second is the protection of citizens and the provision of security in a world of conflicting ideologies. The third is the civilisation that we want to cherish and protect in Europe from internal and external threats. We can achieve these objectives for our citizens because our country as a member of the European Union and as a contracting party to the European Convention on Human Rights is part of a political and economic value community. The international legal order is a bright spot in dark days. I have prepared this contribution with my colleague Joris Backer, whom I can replace today. I would like to ask, on his behalf, what is going on with the further implementation of the 2020 Backer motion on the broader welfare analysis of EU membership for the Netherlands. When I worked as a diplomat myself, I was proud to say that human rights are the basis for sustainable stability. In the words of the predecessor of Minister Hoekstra, his party mate Maxime Verhagen, if he would hear that I quote him in the First Chamber; will anyone pass that on to him? Speaking of which, human rights apply to everyone, everywhere and always. Those were the days. Putin doesn't see it that way. It's obvious. Putin has been violating the territorial integrity of the neighbouring Ukraine for years. Think of the annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine with the taking down of MH17. Meanwhile, Russia was the main pillar of Bashar Al-Assad's crimes against its people in Syria. Our colleagues have already asked this, but I also ask the Minister: what else could we have done in relation to Russia? The promise of freedom in connection with the prospect of a better life and peace and prosperity has been called into question by the Ukrainian people. For D66, the Ukrainian people have the same right to do so as we all do. The protection that many Ukrainian citizens had hoped for from NATO was lacking. There are, of course, reasons for this, such as the nuclear threat, but that is of little use to this population. Political protection in the form of political solidarity was and has been shown by the European Union, even in remarkable unity and even resulting in EU financing of military expenditure. Does the Minister consider that the Netherlands makes a proportionate contribution to military supplies? If not, what could be the next step? What risk assessment does the cabinet make of this? On the battlefield, the civilization we thought we could cherish on this continent has turned out to be a thin layer. It seems that the right of war, which codifies the minimum level of humane association with each other in times of war, has been violated by the Russian army in the areas around Kiev, Boetsha and Marioepol. I'll come back to this later. The Minister has been on the spot and undoubtedly has an informed picture of what options President Zelensky is still available to defend his country. What is the assessment of the Minister of Choices for Ukraine, in addition to fighting to the bitter end? What choices does the Minister see for Russia? I realize these are big questions. We do not have a clear answer, but in such a debate we must have an investigative attitude together. What can the EU do for Ukraine in the short term? How does the Minister see Zelensky's critical response to the lack of clear support from the Netherlands for his country's aspirations to become a member of the European Union in the future? And what commitment does the government think the EU should have towards Russia? Mr. Chairman. It took at least three events to have the inward political debate in our country for the first time really different from what we have done with each other over the past decade. The question is whether 2022 for our children and grandchildren will sound like 1914, 1933, 1940, or as a new turning point, or a Zeitenwente, as the eastern neighbours call it so beautiful, in which, despite the dark days of war and crisis, we managed to absorb the boomerang of history and really protected and nurtured European values and civilisation, in which European cooperation turned out to be a light. I opened the war in Ukraine, but there are at least two other events that give many people sleepless nights: the consequences of the corona pandemic and the climate crisis. Last year I had to call my mother and my daughter if they had to be evacuated in Maastricht and Roermond, and then it really comes very close to home. What the Russian war in Ukraine, the corona pandemic and the climate crisis have in common is that they portray our own vulnerability. It is up to us to build confidence that the unparalleled resilience that is sometimes invisible in our European cooperation is now much better exploited to meet the challenges together. That was already visible in the corona pandemic. In this context, I ask the Minister what is the status of the Dutch application for funds from the corona recovery fund. To the great satisfaction of the D66 Group, the basis for a more active Europe policy was already explicitly laid down in the government agreement of the Rutte IV cabinet. Both Minister Kaag and Minister Hoekstra went to Maastricht. Indeed, a good time: 30 years after the Maastricht Treaty was concluded. There was a supportive, more flexible attitude of Minister Kaag at the follow-up phase of the Stability and Growth Pact for the post-corona period. We also welcome Minister Hoekstra's constructive speech on further political and strategic cooperation in the EU. Other colleagues have already asked for the follow-up to the citizens' councils and the conference on the future of Europe. My group also likes to hear more about this. In the YouTube registration of the Minister's speech, I noticed that he himself was very positive about the possibilities that this could offer in the discussion with the audience in the audience. The Russian war in Ukraine has suddenly added a whole new geopolitical dimension to this more active Europe policy to the cautious wording of the coalition agreement. It reminds me of what Loesje wrote: it is so dark that I see lights everywhere. The D66 Group sees this as an appropriate motto for the Ukrainians, the rest of European society and certainly for ourselves. We wonder if the war was the eurekament for Minister Hoekstra. Was that the moment when he realized that the battle in Ukraine is at its core a bigger issue than just an act of war, that Europe as a democratic continent must defend itself against an inconspicuous autocracy? Was this also the time when the Minister realized that much more extensive cooperation in the EU is needed for this than the Dutch Government has previously considered desirable and possible? My group is therefore happy to hear how the Minister sees the following statement in the Council of State's Annual Report 2021. I quote: 'This war forces us to think carefully about the importance and value of the international legal order. A robust international legal order is important not only in times of war, but also in peacetime."" The enhanced strategic and defence cooperation in the EU is seen by my group as a light for both Dutch citizens and Ukrainian citizens in the long term. Then cooperation within NATO's European countries will also have to involve better division of tasks and procurement of military equipment and not just increasing defence budgets while maintaining inefficiencies that are still there. My group would like to hear more about what the Minister called a defensive strike in his Maastricht speech: more investment, more specialisation and much better cooperation. What does this mean in practice? And where are we gonna get the people to do this? What opportunities for better EU/NATO cooperation are there for military cooperation with Germany, the possible accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO and the changing attitude of Denmark towards European defence cooperation? And, not unimportantly, how do we prevent Erdogan from taking the EU hostage in this situation right now? Of course, because of the vulnerability of gas and geographical differences for all these countries, but the decision of these countries to deepen cooperation illustrates how wrong the Russian President's assessment that the EU would be divided and that the Member States would each pursue their own interests. My group also thinks that this is a good thing. Unwantedly, the raid by the large oil and gas producer Russia has confronted many customers with their vulnerability. Despite the difficult energy transition with rising energy prices, affecting households and businesses, and rapidly rising inflation, my group also sees a light here, namely the urgency for European citizens and our government, especially Minister Jetten, of speeding up the necessary transition. In this context, my group would like to hear from the Minister what lessons are learned from the recommendations of sanctions coordinator Stef Blok for better EU cooperation on sanctions. Other Members have already mentioned it, and we can see that the government is prepared to exchange the unanimity rule for certain decisions in the European Council for a majority decision. We believe that this is essential in order to maintain European solidarity. What will the Netherlands do in this? When it comes to protection and civilisation, my group welcomes the enormous solidarity that exists in Europe for the reception of Ukrainian displaced persons. This certainly applies to the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, such as Poland and Moldova. At the same time, my group is uncomfortable with the green light given by the European Commission for the billions that Poland can get from the European Recovery Fund. Has there really been any improvement in the safeguards for the judiciary in Poland to continue to work independently? On the one hand, my group understands the Commission's dilemma now that Poland is receiving so many Ukrainians, but on the other hand it also gives the impression that the principles of the rule of law can be negotiated. What is the position of the Dutch Government on this Commission decision and how does the Minister view the position of Von der Leyen as five members of its Commission disagree with this support to Poland? Mr. Chairman. My group supports the Dutch government's commitment to justice and investigation into war crimes in Ukraine. We also see an important role for the International Criminal Court. How does the Minister assess Ukraine's willingness to become a party to the Treaty of Rome? When it comes to protecting our civilisation, I would particularly like to draw attention to the reports that Russian soldiers are using rape as a weapon of war against Ukrainian women and girls. We hear that men and boys are also victims of this. From other wars and conflicts, we know that when we focus on gender equality in the aftermath of conflicts, there is a greater chance of a lasting peaceful solution. How can the Netherlands play a role within the EU? Here too, we see a light in the darkness, because my group welcomes the decision of the cabinet of 13 May last to focus on a feminist foreign policy, just as other countries within the EU, such as Sweden, Germany and France, have already done. For the viewers at home, I would like to quote Margot Wallström, who said that as long as 50% of the world's population has less access to education, work, health and political participation, we must work on this so that everyone can have a better future. This decision came in response to questions from our group about the joint communication on the EU-Gender Action Plan that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had produced a report that was the basis of this decision. The letter and the report raise a number of questions, which we will discuss in writing. The State of the Union shall include a comprehensive paragraph on gender equality, sexual and reproductive health and rights and equal rights for Ihbti persons. The conclusions of my report The gender dimension of foreign policy, which I wrote for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, show that a feminist foreign policy can only be successful if ministers show the political will to work actively for this policy. How will the Minister make a personal effort to ensure that this decision of the Council of Ministers is widely supported within all relevant ministries? How is he going to promote this new policy in the public debate? What does this decision mean for the commitment of the Netherlands at national, European and international level? In view of the worrying developments in certain EU Member States regarding the rights of Ihbti individuals, my group also asks what the Dutch are doing within the EU. I notice in the Council of Europe that our country still has a good reputation as a pioneer of these rights, but is that true? And while we are at the Council of Europe: as leader of the Dutch delegation of the PACE, I would like to draw attention to this briefly. The Istanbul Convention on Combating Violence against Women can be a good guide for feminist foreign policy. How does the Minister see the opportunities for the promise of greater freedom, protection of citizens and the cherishing of civilisation on the European continent in cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe? In conclusion. For the D66 Group, it is precisely in this turbulent time that the Dutch government should ensure that the European Union provides a light in the darkness when it comes to the promise of freedom and security, protection and civilisation for the Dutch and all other Europeans. The D66 Group looks forward with interest to answering the questions.",True,0.073,0.786,0.141,0.9995,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 32, Session 6 (2022-06-07)",2022-06-07,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 6,Meeting 32,Sitting 2022-06-07,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,PetraStienen,"Stienen, Petra",F,1965,57.0,True,6
236,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u81,"Thank you to Mr Koole for this beautiful question. When Margot Wallström started as a champion of feminist foreign policy, she also got quite critical, also from the Netherlands, saying: we are already committed to women's rights worldwide. But this is going a little further. This is really about looking at equality for all genders in the economic, social, military and political fields, so man, woman and everything in between, also looking at how to shape that in a realistic way in terms of rights, representation and resources. I would like to share with this Chamber a figure from the European Institute for Gender Equality. If you calculate it, it will cost violence, gender-based violets there violence against women is part of European society EUR 366 billion a year. So I understand very well that 'feminist foreign policy' sounds like we want to go to the moon for some people, but if you look at what is actually happening, at this violence behind the front door in our European countries, it costs so much only at social costs.

237,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u97,"Mr. Chairman. My group is not considering a single motion, I repeat: no motion for a resolution. But let me start with a quote. ""European cooperation is a reality, a path on which going back is not possible and undesirable for an internationally oriented trading country. That forces politicians to work on further institutional improvements."" This statement by the minister's predecessor, Mr Luns, is certainly not dated, but rather guiding the VVD: constantly working on improvements. A way back is not possible and is also undesirable from an economic and a trade perspective. That was so in the early days of the European Community, and that is still the case. Cooperation is crucial in many policy areas. This has been clear since the creation of the European Union 30 years ago. In the field of JHA, independent action in asylum and migration policy is no longer conceivable. This also applies to the fight against crime and terrorism. Mr. Chairman. Speaking of bad guys, the war in Ukraine and the unacceptable, ruthless actions of the Russians force us to strengthen European cooperation in many areas. In the annual General European Reviews, the document is based on the State of the Union. I'll do that again this year. I will focus on some specific issues. It is impossible, however important other policy areas, such as climate and energy policy, to address everything within the deadline. But even without general European reflections, these issues will undoubtedly enrich our agenda in the near future. Mr. Chairman. The government summarises the priorities identified by the Commission in the State of the Union in three horizontal themes in the strengthening of the Union and thus brings more focus. That is a great improvement with last year's document, which was rather a dry list than a policy document. I shall deal with these three themes: the Union as a geopolitical leader, 'leader' with short-term good governance and respect for the rule of law principles and the strengthening of economic and social convergence. In addition to these three subjects, I will briefly address the findings of the CPB report, which was issued following the Backer motion, and ask about the results of the Conference on the future of the European Union. Now that the Minister is often in diplomatic circles, I will pay less attention to own resources and financial frameworks. My group has asked further questions to the Minister for Finance and is anxious to wait for the answers. As you know, Mr President, it is quite unusual to talk about money in diplomatic circles. It is considered a somewhat vulgar subject. You have money and you don't talk about it, and if you don't have it, you certainly don't. Now you can also imagine how plightful the position of a financial council is at a representation or an embassy. However, the VVD Group agrees with the information provided that the government is not in favour of a modernisation fund to be set up, nor of a social fund under Fit for 55 plans and also wants to avoid the adaptation of the Multiannual Financial Framework. If the Minister can clearly confirm these some common passages in the State of the Union, then my group would very much appreciate it. Let us begin with a stronger Europe in the world. Europe must be a player and not a playing field. This is a popular one-liner that has been in a somewhat different context since 24 February. For concrete policy measures, the government refers to the Strategic Compass recently adopted in March. But if you read the 47 pages, you will find that it is mainly a list of good intentions and the pursuit of closer cooperation with many bilateral partners, regional and multilateral organisations. Better cooperation is, of course, desirable, but what is the stake? What do you want to achieve? Organisations such as the African Union, which I have often dealt with in the past, do not excel in efficiency and have very few powers. In short, the question to the Minister is what the government wants. Strengthening EU-NATO cooperation is, of course, excellent. However, the role of Mr Borrell and his CFSP institution, the so-called External Action Service, in which efficiency can also be achieved, is not exactly welcomed by my group. Here again the question: what should the enhanced cooperation look like in concrete terms? Is the role of individual Member States subordinate to EU input? Is an additional decision-making layer introduced before action can be taken? And what is the role of the European Parliament in this area? The strategic document also talks about speeding up decision-making. Can the government indicate how to achieve this within the current Treaty provisions? There must also be great financial solidarity and solidity in this context. This isn't gonna work out. The Minister will be able to explain to the VVD Group what this means. Finally. A rapidly deployable EU capacity of up to 5,000 men is also being created. Beautiful. But why 5,000? Isn't that too modest? In what situations are these troops deployed? Who's in command? How is NATO involved and how is the bill paid? Europe must become stronger, more independent, more efficient and more effective. This can be read on almost every page of the document. For the CFSP, this operation should be improved by the introduction of qualified majority voting. This strengthens the democratic Europe against the more influential autocrats. This was emphasised by the Minister in his Europe speech on Schumann Day, 9 May last. I'd like to nuance that image a little bit. Take the French president. The current one seems to be a strong supporter of qualified majority voting. The French President must share his influence with the government in the domestic sphere, which sometimes results in a somewhat difficult cohabitation, just look at Mitterand and Chirac. That partnership didn't always go too far. In foreign policy matters, the President is virtually autonomous. He doesn't consult his prime minister, let alone the Assemblée nationale. The Sphinx Mitterand was a clear example of this. The question arises as to why the French President would call the foreign representative Borrell if he did not even call his own Prime Minister, other than to give him orders. That is not what we mean by strengthening cooperation. And I have another nuance. Some decisions are already being taken by qualified majority, such as in the case of the redistribution of 120,000 refugees across the Member States in 2015. This policy, which was adopted without unanimity, has completely failed and has increased the removal between Poland, Hungary and some other Member States and Brussels. In conclusion, should a decision be taken by a majority or a qualified majority through a new decision-making mechanism, will the countries which have been overruled comply with the commitments made in the absence of a functioning sanction mechanism? I think I doubt it. I have a purely hypothetical example. What would the Union have done if Hungary avoided an import ban through the existing direct oil pipeline, which does not cover EU territory? Nothing. That is why they got their way last week by excluding this section from a possible boycott in the long term. Please have a reflection from the Minister. The second issue I would like to raise is the importance of good governance and the principles of rule of law. The government attaches great importance to this, and it was evident from the debate we had on this in February that this was laid down in the State of the Union.",True,0.057,0.808,0.135,0.9988,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 32, Session 6 (2022-06-07)",2022-06-07,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 6,Meeting 32,Sitting 2022-06-07,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,PimvanBallekom,"van Ballekom, Pim",M,1956,66.0,False,6
238,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u140,"Thank you, Mr President. Let me begin by thanking the Members of your Chamber for the breadth and depth of the issues that are at the heart of or touch on what we are talking about today, namely the General European Political Reviews. Perhaps I could also say to Members through you that I consider it a great privilege to exchange views here on this large and broad subject. As almost all Members have said, we do so in an extremely loaded time. Almost all of us, I think Mr Van Rooijen is the exception from after the Second World War, but we all realize that the era we entered at the end of February seems very difficult to relate to everything we have experienced since the Second World War. I could also hear the emotion in his voice with Mr Van Rooijen, but I think we all share it. There is something really going on in Europe. In addition, I do not want to take anything away from all the geopolitical trammel we have seen since 1945, of course. But what we now see in the military sense in Europe has been without precedent in many respects since 1945. This has all kinds of repercussions for the European Union and, of course, for the Netherlands. The attack on Ukraine is not only an attack on Ukraine, but also an attack on the values that the Netherlands and Europe stand for. I'm sure of it. It is an attack on the rule of law, on sovereignty, on the borders of other countries, on human rights. That is why it is so relevant to let us know exactly what we think about it and that we are trying to help Ukraine in all possible ways in the fight that is currently under way. Mr. Chairman. Of course, there's a lot more. That is sometimes an extension, like the rule of law. It has always been important, but is actually independent of the debate on geopolitics. That came through in the debate. I will answer all these questions as best I can. I have to say that I didn't tarf it exactly, but if I had, I would have come up with a few hundred questions. So I'm gonna try to cluster things a little bit. I hope the members will forgive me for that. I know that you always insist that I kick off saying in what order I intend to deal with the various subjects. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would have thought as follows. I'll start with Ukraine. In it, I take the sanctions, the Dutch Accountability, the weapons and everything that has to do with them. Then I'll close that block. That brings me to block two, namely everything that has to do with enlargement. I am referring to Ukraine, but more questions have been asked about enlargement. That's the second block. In the third block, I deal extensively with geopolitics in general. Fourthly, the Conference on Europe will follow. A lot of questions have been asked about that. The fifth is the rule of law. As a sixth, there will be a large-scale block of other issues, including the Council of Europe, migration, the SGP and a number of other important issues. I'll make a manly attempt to maintain that structure. If I stray from the right path, I know how you'll react to that. Mr. Chairman. I'll start with Ukraine. I have just briefly outlined how hard what is going on there should be pressing on what we have to do. It is my belief that there is no misunderstanding about this in this house either. I have therefore just briefly referred to it, and I would like to say a little more about it in the first place: it is of the utmost importance that we, as the European Union, but also as the Netherlands, stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and provide arms. That is what is most needed at the moment. Moreover, these weapons are essential if you want to return to the negotiating table in acceptable circumstances. That is what we are doing in the field of humanitarian aid. That is what we are doing in the area of economic aid. We do this by receiving refugees in the Netherlands. We do that by helping diplomatically, as good and as angry as that goes in those very difficult circumstances. We are doing this by contributing to accountability at this stage, because ultimately those responsible for this will also have to answer for it. As far as we're concerned, we need a judge. So we are also trying to contribute to this in very complicated circumstances. Mr. Chairman. There are many questions on this subject, which I will answer as best I can. I shall begin with Mr Van Apeldoorn's question. He asked how we're gonna make sure we don't end up in a cold war for decades. As far as I am concerned, it starts with the fact that we have to keep two things in mind in the war that is now going on. First of all, there is the continued helping of Ukraine. That's very important, morally as well. I just listed the axes we're trying to get through. The second is a bit out of the debate, but I have said it regularly at the beginning of the war. By the way, I wasn't the only one in that. It is also extremely important that we do not end up in an escalation of the war by the wrong choices or an accident with all kinds of risks that could lead to a third world war. That has disappeared a little from the debate, but it is important to continue to do so. That was, as far as I am concerned, a justified argument not to respond, for example, to the request for setting up a no-fly zone. If you did, it would have all kinds of repercussions. Then you're not just going to force planes to land or shoot them out of the sky in Ukraine if necessary. No, then you'll also go after the communication centers on which those planes depend. They are not necessarily in Ukraine. That's what I wanted to say about a wider, hotter conflict. As far as the prevention of a cold war is concerned, I think we should be realistic about who is the aggressor here. It does not apply here: where two have a conflict, there are two faults. This is a war of aggression, without any reasonable reason initiated by Russia after months of building troops there at the border. Russia is fully responsible for this war. This also means that not only during this period, but also after this period, we cannot simply go to the order of the day. Then billions of dollars of damage has been done in Ukraine and thousands or tens of thousands have been killed by the military, but also by the civilian population. Then there are probably also far beyond the places I have visited on a large scale the most terrible war crimes committed. So we can't move on to the order of the day. Does that mean we'll automatically end up in a new cold war? No, not necessarily. However, I would like to stress that, in my view, we are once again entering a phase in which the values that we believe should apply universally are under great pressure, not only from Russia but also from other actors. In many ways, we will have to fight again the automatic acceptance of these values, because there is talk of human rights, of the sovereignty of countries and of many of the things we considered universal. You undoubtedly know the saying 'history knows no definition Victories' and that is unfortunately also the case. In order to protect these values, we will have to enter into dialogue with the 141 countries which have expressed their disapproval of the war in the United Nations, but also with the 35 who have abstained. My assessment is that, not only with Russia, but also with a number of other countries, we are facing a longer stage in which we do not automatically agree on the automation of human rights, democracy, peace and security, and so on. It is a somewhat longer answer, but I would have said otherwise in my introduction, Mr President.",True,0.132,0.785,0.083,-0.9982,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 32, Session 6 (2022-06-07)",2022-06-07,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 6,Meeting 32,Sitting 2022-06-07,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,WopkeHoekstra,"Hoekstra, Wopke",M,1975,47.0,False,6

We will also have to look at when it is possible to reach a ceasefire and under what circumstances. Then the negotiations must begin. Italy, for example, came up with a peace plan two weeks ago, I believe. It also talks about relations with Russia in the longer term. We haven't heard so much about that since.

So in itself, of course, that's quite right. The question is, in particular, how we help Ukraine to reach the negotiating table in the best possible circumstances. The hard reality is that we help them best by ensuring that they are in the best possible position on the battlefield. In addition, we have to keep two things in mind every time. One: Russia has begun this war. And two: Russia, I know that from the inside room too, and we all know that through the newspaper in all those conversations that were initially grafted in, zero point zero and no movement was made. So, of course, those conversations were stopped there at some point. You have to add that I understand very well that those from the Ukrainian side, who literally hear from the first hand of their own people about what is happening to her in the area of murder and rape, and so on, will change their minds twice before they are allowed to lend themselves to some sort of show negotiation. So where we can support Ukraine, we will, but it really has to go under the conditions that are acceptable to them. In the end, it is up to them to make that very complicated assessment of how long it is militaryly appropriate to continue fighting, what that balance looks like, even in the military sense, and what it means for one's own lives. I would also find it really inappropriate if the Netherlands or others wanted to say all kinds of things about that and square public, but it does mean, and it must continue to mean, that we are taking everything out of the box. Moreover, the Netherlands is doing more than its fair share, but I will come to that later with support through weapons, accountability and sanctions.

I think it is up to Ukraine to determine that, because Ukrainians pay an extremely high price.

242,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u238,"You lose the sense of time here sometimes. But that's entirely up to me, Mr. Chairman. We're at block three. We have already done a lot of that, because much of what is geopolitical and has been put forward by Members also affects Ukraine. But I might be able to say a few things about it. Mr Van Ballekom asked about the Strategic Compass and the common security policy. In order to reassure him, decision-making in launching EU military missions will of course continue to take place on the basis of unanimity. In particular, it talks about more flexible implementation of decisions taken unanimously by the Council. That's the way people look at it. The use of Dutch military personnel is always subject to the national democratic decision-making process. Then there's just Rule 100. It's not gonna change anything. Frankly, I do not speak very many people in Dutch politics who would like to change that. Then there is a question from Mr Van Ballekom about the purpose of the Strategic Compass. The aim is to become more self-reliant as the EU and to take more responsibility for its own security. I would like to stress once again that the cornerstone of the security policy of the Netherlands and of many EU Member States was and will remain NATO. Mr Van Ballekom will agree with me. You do want the EU to gain geopolitical strength and fill the big gap between real security policy and economic policy, but that is different from the fact that the EU would make this NATO role redundant or replace it. That's out of the question. My impression is also that almost all the main players are aware of this. What I myself find very remarkable and positive is that I have now had a number of meetings with the EU colleagues to which the American, Canadian and British Foreign Ministers and the Secretary-General of NATO joined. But the opposite has also happened a number of times, namely a NATO meeting with the Foreign Ministers, with which Swedish and Finnish colleagues joined. They are now in the process, of course, but before that was mentioned they were already there. Borrell and others were among them again. It is therefore realized on both sides of the dividing line how important it is for these two organisations to cooperate much more with each other, without, by the way, affecting the specific task concept. When you look at that group, it's pretty clear that's the way it's supposed to be. I believe that out of the present 30 NATO countries, I like the exact numbers too good, there are 20 or something of a similar size EU member. So that's really the way it's supposed to be. Then there was a question from Mr Van Ballekom and many others about abolishing the veto. What about QMV and Member States that do not comply with those decisions? The monitoring of this implementation would then be of primary political nature. You should also agree, not only on abolishing the veto, but also on the implications, especially in the following case. I'm gonna join you in Van Ballekom's thinking. Suppose you agreed on a sanction package that has repercussions on trade. Then you should also find the legal basis in the agreements we have made with regard to trade in order to appeal to a Member State to break the unity. The first step is, of course, that you agree on abolishing the veto. The Netherlands is in favour of this. Germany, Spain and a number of other countries are, but we are not finished there. Then there is Mr Van Rooijen's question about my view of Europe. I hope he will agree with what I have explained in the State of the Union, the letter of Parliament on foreign affairs policy of May 2020 and the other documents that have gone to the Chamber. I was, of course, gilded that he also specifically asked for a Christian-democratic impact. I must, of course, formulate with caution, because I am here to speak on behalf of the cabinet and as a simple servant of the Crown and not as a member of my party. But the fact that he brought it up, of course, given his progress, I am only very happy to hear. I hope Mr Van Rooijen will also recognise that many of the issues relating to values, to the rule of law, to geopolitics, to the role that Europe should assume, are in line with what he and I both think. We have, of course, exchanged views on this more often. I have one final comment to make. Many of the cases in the first letter from March/April were almost ready before the war began. They are, of course, adapted to current events, but we could leave many of the geopolitical comments in the draft on paper. At most we have provided more examples, but we had already formulated that thought in the Ministry. Mr. Chairman. I'll take a look. I've done most of the geopolitics. I think I have also said a few words about Mr Van Ballekom's question about strengthening EU-NATO cooperation. I hope he'll be okay with that. I must say, however, that you see here again that such a dire situation leads to things that had not been obvious before. You would think ""these institutions are both in and around Brussels, so that should be easy to arrange,"" but that extra push has now been given by the war, by the crisis. Mr. Chairman. Perhaps I should mention one thing that has been half-asked for: the process of ratifying the accession of Finland and Sweden. I very much hope it will take place. With another Member State, we still have some problems to resolve, but I very much hope that before or at the Madrid Summit everyone can agree with the accession of these two countries. I consider this to be highly justifiable in terms of content. These countries are not only extremely close allies of the Netherlands, but would also really be an asset to NATO's position. Mr Koole asked if any thought had been given to the disadvantages on this positive side. For example, he referred to that long border of 1,300 kilometers. That's absolutely true. And yet my belief is that it will make the world more stable and safer. Moreover, I believe that these two countries, with whom we work so closely, have a great deal in common with the Netherlands in terms of the rule of law, human rights and finance. At all events, you should look for reasons not to include those countries. But you can add that both countries of Sweden have made quite a catch-up in recent years and Finland has already learned a lesson from the Finnish-Russian war of 1939................................................................................................................................................ Anyone who has ever studied this war and the lessons Finland has learned from it knows that it is also able to mobilise the entire population in the event of an attack. I think Finland, quite rightly, has learned the lessons from the Winter War. The Finnish Prime Minister recently said that if you look at the list of countries whose own people are willing to defend their own territory, Finland is at the top of that list. That's how it is in the culture of the country. That is another reason to look at it positively. They are countries that I think I can see in military circles too, that you want to be wrong in a shooter's pit. There is another point I would like to make in connection with Mr Koole's question. It's about the trial. Of course, the cabinet, the Council of State, and the First and Second Chamber are involved in the process of accession. Perhaps I can say here in all courtesy that a little bit of the Netherlands is also being looked at with the question of whether we can do our procedures faster than the last two times. We were once the last and once the one-after-last, and then we were only the one-after-last because a cabinet had fallen in another country. Our procedures are relatively long. On the cabinet side, we will do everything in our power to ensure that this process is speeded up, and we would agree at the Madrid Summit. I would also like to make that comment here. If there are things the cabinet can do to enable dialogue to take place as quickly as possible, we will take it for granted, but perhaps I can also bring that to the attention of the Chamber.

So Finland would end up in a war under the old regime too, and that would have all kinds of repercussions for all the Member States of the European Union. That's important to realize. But of course Mr Koole is right: you have 1,300 kilometers where you are literally eye-to-eye with the Russians in theory. There's no such situation right now. I myself believe that the request of a country which is very close to us, which is, first and foremost, combined with the open policy that we have, the security situation as it is now, and the military resources that these countries have, are all very good arguments for doing so, rather than not doing so.

Of course, trade policy also has a geopolitical side, but it does like to be within the rules of international law and multilateralism.

250,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-07-eerstekamer-6.u451,"I would like to look at that, by the way, with the comment I made last time. I really do see the importance of it. It is good to hear that Mr Van Apeldoorn is even more optimistic about the exact conclusions than I was told. Let's just hope it happens. That'd be great. I believe that we are in complete agreement on the added value of a possible summit. Mrs Karimi asked what this treaty change was for. To this I can say that the Treaty allows for the use of QMV rather than unanimity almost across the whole of the CFSP. This is also explained in Article 31 of the EU Treaty. It also stipulates that the clauses cannot be used for decisions having military or defence implications. That's what I wanted to say in her direction. I had given her an answer about the minimum wage and the term. I've checked that, but when it comes to implementation, you have to think about what I just described. Mr Koole was quite right to ask, because I somehow lost it in the first term to China and he specifically quoted Piraeus. That's something I've been surprised about before. I cannot escape the impression that, throughout the dynamics that started at the time, geopolitics had to fall short in the financial and economic negotiations, apart from the fact that there are different schools or thought about how essential that Chinese interest is in that port, but it is there and it is coming back on a continuous basis. I really recognize Mr Koole's point. Fortunately, what you see more widely is that Member States of the Union are much more aware of the shadows of China's operations in the Union. This is the case, but I also mentioned the case with Lithuania. It is also about matters relating to espionage and concerns about who comes here under what pretexts. Fortunately, more balance has been struck in China's appreciation as a player. On the one hand, it is self-evident, logical to trade with it, but there is really much more to be said about it. You can also see this in the document that the cabinet made two years ago, I believe, at the request of the House of Representatives, the so-called China strategy, so you can see that that image has been tilting in the Netherlands for a long time, but fortunately you can also see that in other countries. My guess is that we are really not at the end of the song and that reorientation will continue. Mr Koole also asked where the EU is different from the United States. Mr Koole has undoubtedly also read Mr Blinken's speech. I thought that was an excellent speech, but it has three anchors that are slightly different from the anchors of the European Union. I believe that we have expressed the combination of partner, economic competitor and system rival in an unwise way. At the same time, I think that Blinken's speech has a lot of nuances that are very similar to European nuances. This was also less sharp than some commentators might have expected. In this you can only read much more clearly that America, much more than the European Union, is also a player in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, Europe is not active there; at the very beginning of the war in Ukraine we happened to sit together in Paris to talk to a number of countries in the region about how Europe can also ensure stability there. But America is, of course, a geopolitical and also a military player of great importance and is therefore much more prominently present there. You can actually read that in Blinken's statement. Again, I found them really well layered and sensible. Mr Koole also asked, quite rightly, about the terrible reports of human rights violations. That must also be part of that dialogue. This means that the European Union should raise this issue, but also that the Prime Minister and I should mention it in the bilateral talks, even though that is sometimes a complicated message, which you can taste as if it does not automatically fall into fertile soil. But that doesn't change the fact that we have to keep doing that. Then Mrs Huizinga asked about subsidiarity. I would like to say on this point that perhaps I have failed to do so in its direction, namely that these two principles, subsidiarity and proportionality, are guiding principles in European legislation and regulation, and that we have been committed for years to genuinely strict application. I remember from the time I was sitting here myself, but I can see that now when I see these BNC-fiches coming along, which is also given a lot of attention to these two issues. As far as subsidiarity is concerned, this has been done again in the first period I was in the First Chamber. Then there was such a so-called subsidiarity exercise: what do we all mean by that? In my opinion, we are also much more detailed about this by means of these BNC-fiches. This is a system that is far from all the Member States, and we explicitly include both chambers in our weighting. Of course, the Chamber may deviate from that again, but my impression is quite frankly that that system is working and that this appreciation is really shared with the Chamber precisely in relation to those two parts of the Netherlands, which are so important to the Netherlands, without ignoring them. Then Mrs Huizinga asked about the importance of the fact that the Netherlands is one of those six founders. That's a fair question. In itself, of course, that may not be material, because it is about the here and now. It's interesting, though, that it comes by all the time. So very often, in conversations with me, countries link a particular subject to ""you are one of the founders."" In the informal sense, therefore, the somewhat newer Member States, the newest group of Member States, certainly attach some importance to this. How does that translate in practice? I can't put that in a number, and I also understand why you write that down. That feedback, criticism, I take it. But it is interesting to see that this often comes along as point nebenbei, not with the first group and not with the group of, for example, Spain and Portugal, but with the countries that are shorter. Mr. Chairman. I had ended the first term with the clear impression that I had said a lot about the right of veto and the balance. On repeated occasions and by Mrs Nanninga, I have just understood that it did not come close to good enough. So I'm a little puzzled about how to solve that, but maybe I should say the following about it. First of all, the debate on the use of the veto was already conducted in a very detailed way in 2019, also with the Dutch Parliament. This was also the result of a report by Clingendael on our diplomacy and what is effective. At that time, the Chamber also asked for an overview of the use of the veto. Then Minister Blok indicated that giving such a sec overview is actually not possible, precisely because of the point Van Rooijen made earlier: having the veto means that you do not commit it very often. I myself gave that example of Hungary last week. This is very often the case in practice. I am going to say a few words in the direction of Mr Otten, but this is a piece of history. The debate often continues in the Union until either something has died or unanimity has been achieved at a lower point. Of course, Hungary has been the same in recent weeks. What I would like to say again, which was not a misunderstanding between Mrs Nanninga and me in the first term, is the following. When you don't have a veto, of course, you always run the risk of being overvoted. There's no misunderstanding about that. Take Hungary's example. If that veto had no longer existed, my firm conviction is that Hungary would have been outvoted in that situation. If the Netherlands had been in Hungary's position, we would have been overvoted in that case. So that's the loss of a cure? Absolutely, I didn't want to do anything about that. However, I have wished to argue that there is another side to it, namely that the profit in the implementation of policies can actually come to your own. That had occurred in that Hungarian case. For example, I can come up with a number of examples, such as human rights violations and sanctions where the Netherlands is often on the side of the medal where you would like to do more and other countries oppose it. So I think there is something to win in a material sense, but in a formal sense, of course, if you take something out of your toolbox, you can't use it anymore and so you can be overvoted. Again, this is specifically about a part of the policy that affects foreign countries. So this is not about matters that affect defence, nor is it about taxation and about matters that relate to the SGP that now requires unanimity and a lot of other things. This is really about foreign policy, as stated in the coalition agreement, which has been further specified in one or two sentences. Mr. Chairman.

252,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-08-tweedekamer-4.u28,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It feels like a great privilege to speak here today, in this house. To be quite honest, when I was a little boy, member of the Lower House of the States-General was not at the top of my list of favourite professions. Fireman, policeman and all kinds of exciting and heroic activities formed my picture of my future. It's all been a little different. Mr. Chairman. My parents were of the generation who came with the necessary mental scars from World War II and the period after that. My mother lost her father in the aftermath of the war in 1945. My father didn't come back from a work camp until late 1945 in Czechoslovakia. The following year, he was called to leave for Indonesia as a military officer. That's a start to the maturity you don't want in your 20s. Their history tells me I've never taken freedom for granted. I see freedom as a hard-won and unprecedented achievement of this country. My father was a crane operator and my mother was a housewife, as was often very common in the 1950s and 1960s. They participated in and participated in the reconstruction of the Netherlands after the war. In 1965 I was born into a warm family. I grew up in a very pleasant neighborhood in Maassluis. On Sunday we went to the reformed church. My primary school was, as was natural in those circles, the Christian Doctor Abraham Kuyper School. As children, we got a decent education, but also with a lot of space to develop ourselves. The standards and values we received were undoubtedly influenced by ecclesiastical principles, but above all by common sense. What I have learned from my parents in particular is that you are ultimately responsible for the choices you make, whatever the outcome, and that you must always keep an eye on others and put out a helping hand when someone needs it. After high school, the Marnix Mavo, It must have had to do with the fact that I just got the space from my parents to choose for myself, but also as every teenager had the need to turn me off against what was ""normal"" or ""normal."" That didn't say my parents were always happy with my choices. I can still remember very lively discussions about clothing and long hair. In the end, I didn't go to the decent laboratory school in Delft, where I was admitted, but I chose the MBO programme Social Services in Leiden. Then I went to the Social Academy in Rotterdam to become a social worker. Now the critical listener will undoubtedly be wondering what kind of liberal phenomena have occurred to me. In the early 1980s, the Social Academy was not really a liberal club in the political sense. On the contrary, ""left of the middle"" is really a big understatement. Yet there, and in the period after that, lies an important basis in my thinking about freedom, responsibility and social justice. After the Social Academy I went to work in the care of the homeless, at the Salvation Army, and later as a general social worker. I met a lot of people back then and offered a helping hand. From debt to relationship problems, from addiction problems to homelessness and from unemployment to children's education questions. It's just a small part of what I've been told as an aid worker. But in all these contacts, almost always the question was: help me, help us get back on our feet. One time that is easier than the other time, but it has led me to say that I do not want to write people off. I want to look at solutions that work, looking for new ways to give a meaningful boost or a strong push in the right direction. The first years of my working life have undoubtedly made a lot of impression and have strengthened the foundation of who I have finally become. Together with the standards and values I have received from home, this is the basis of my political choices. The core of it is the freedom to organise your life as you wish and take responsibility for yourself, but also for the people around you. Mr. Chairman. The enormous resilience that people have to return to life after a setback is often unexpectedly great. Also, the desire of almost everyone to organise their own lives is a reason why I am positive about the possibilities of people. For me, that means looking at what someone can do. However, from the experience I have just described, I also know that not everyone always has enough resilience to really take that direction. Then, as a society, we have a responsibility to take steps, to ensure that resilience and self-responsibility can be restored. Sometimes when things are really bad, we as a government can offer a helping hand. The Law on Debt Remodelling Natural Persons, the Wsnp, is such a means of helping those who have gotten stuck in problematic debt. It is a far-reaching helping hand, because a large part of it takes away its own financial direction. In the present amendment to this law, a number of sharp sides of the law are modified to improve the flow to the Wsnp. But as far as the VVD is concerned, this change of law is a part of and a starting point for a more fundamental discussion on how we deal with debt and causes of debt in society. I have rarely met anyone who chooses to be in debt. More and more external debt, such as high inflation and high energy prices, as well as government restrictive measures during the pandemic, have caused SMEs andzzp'ers to be unable to do their job and to get into trouble. Mr. Chairman. The preferential position of the government, the reasonable deadlines in which a debt restructuring must be completed and the re-launch with a clean slate are just a few examples of topics on which we would like to discuss with the cabinet, in addition to the agreements we have already made in the coalition agreement. In short, we want to discuss the human dimension of debt relief. We look forward with great interest to the Minister for Poverty Policy's note on poverty reduction and problematic debt. The reduction in the time limit for the good faith test will be reduced from five to three years. In our view, three years is a time-limit which is also more common within debt relief. So we support them. The VVD also supports the addition of what I conveniently call a ""hardness clause."" It is a good thing that the judge is given the opportunity to admit people in distressing cases. I would like to draw particular attention to the importance of the quality and expertise of directors. For example, it is essential for an SME with problematic debts admitted to the Wsnp to have a director with specific knowledge of SMEs. For example, for an independent entrepreneur, the conduct of an administration or the obligations he or she has with the Tax Administration, such as sales tax, are completely different from for a private individual. Managing is important, but there has been great dissatisfaction with the proliferation of directors in the municipality for many years. On behalf of my group, I would therefore like to ask the Minister, in cooperation with Minister Schouten, to come up with proposals to improve this and to work out the agreed stricter requirements for directors. Finally, Mr President. Even before I could make this maiden speech, I found myself on the front page of De Telegraaf last weekend. Between 100 photos of Dutch MPs I also saw my portrait. According to 77% of the readers of this newspaper, we are too busy with ourselves in this house instead of solving problems. I only see that as an incentive to do my job well. I therefore welcome the fact that I have the opportunity to make my first contribution to this House on such a substantive issue that I am very concerned about. I certainly intend to continue to do so.

255,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-09-tweedekamer-5.u29,"Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I come to the limits of tolerance, particularly with regard to obligations. According to the General Court, EUR 15.5 billion was unlawful. That does not mean that the money is gone or is eclipsed. I also hear those sounds, but that those commitments have not been properly made. In a response from the Minister of Finance to the General Court's analysis, the Minister did not really go into that. I'd like to ask her to do that after all. How does the Minister explain this enormous increase in the unlawful commitments? What improvement process has been deployed in the state service and what is the state of play? Is the Court of Auditors always right? It is an independent College of State.

Then you can have a discussion with each other or that is a valid observation. That is therefore in the cooperation between the ADR and the General Court.

256,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-09-tweedekamer-8.u111,"Mr. Chairman. Allow me to take a very short run through Mr Van der Lee's input on Niccolò Machiavelli and Mr Grinwis' contribution I miss him for a moment, but I am going to do it anyway about the historian and sociologist Max Weber. I do, because it fits so nicely with today's topic. I'm just gonna take advantage of these two names and these two guys. By the way, it's nice that they're mentioned here. Machiavelli is the great diplomat and military strategist from Florence. As we all know, he was a senior official in the Florentine Republic. Van der Lee also referred to this. That's gonna go wrong in 1512, when the De' Medici's come back. In 1513, of course, that beautiful writing will come. The question is: what is the character of that writing, Il Principe? I have been a minority for some time now trying to interpret that piece differently than the majority does. Of course, you have people who say, ""Well, actually, it's an application letter. He wanted to return to the De' Medici's, despite the torture of which he had become the victim. He wanted to return to the regime."" That didn't work out, by the way. Others say: it is actually a trap, because he tells the De' Medici's that they have to live in the city. They didn't do that very cleverly, because they knew, of course, that they could be the victims of another revolution. They lived happily outside the city, at least that was happy for themselves. Or people say it's a satire. I belong to that group. I always thought it was a satire, by the way, from a convinced Republican. You know we're a republic, too, where one family always delivers the president. So in that sense, of course, we recognize ourselves in that Florentine Republic. Then I'll go to Max Weber, the historian and sociologist. We are now about 350 years later, in the 20th century. In his book on politics as a profession, he actually set out the three ideal types of the politician, the public administrator, namely the charismatic beside the authoritarian director. But he also mentions the importance of bureaucracy. If you want a strong republic, you need a strong bureaucracy and strong support. Then I come to today's topic. That is what this debate is about. I've been looking at the websites. I'll see where all the reporters are. They're supposed to be... There are now two! They were not at the Chamber's term, but they have, of course, now come to the floor by Mrs Kaag, Mrs Van Huffelen and I. But first it was completely empty. The attention to that is quite minimal. But journalists, thank you for coming. That is very much appreciated, I say through the chairman. But it is crucial that we have these kinds of things, such as the bureaucratic basis and bureaucracy in the good sense of the word. As we all know, it was also Max Weber who talked about the government finally having the swordpower. The sword power can only be accompanied by... However, Machiavelli also mentioned the enormous importance of keeping the country safe. That is the core task of the government. We now have a key role to play in ensuring that there is also a strong economy. So I think it is quite right that these two great names have been mentioned. These are entirely in line with this debate. Against that background, I give this brief introduction. I do, because I haven't been asked a lot of questions. In this way, the longer speech by the Minister of Finance is not going to go away. Questions have been asked about VWS, for example: how is it that accounting is not yet in order, while care covers a third of expenditure? Of course, you have all taken note of all the relevant documents, including the progress report ""Room Letter Progress Financial Management of the Ministry of VWS."" You have seen that the financial function has at least been strengthened in 2021. However, these problems have not been resolved in one year. This calls for a multi-annual approach. The good news is that the financial administration, the accounting of the Ministry, has now been strengthened. You can also see this in better informing Parliament and guaranteeing budget law. In the Court's view, where quite dramatic percentages were still visible earlier, 98% of the cases have now gone well. This can be seen in all the underlying reports. In addition, the Structural Guarantee Financial Management programme will further consider how to further strengthen the financial function. I think you should say that big steps have been taken in 2021, but we are not yet at VWS. There's more to be done. That, too, is clear. In this context, there was also a question about financial management at the Ministry. People have joined us. But what is being done with the rest of the department, with regard to the responsibility that you must also feel outside the management of the people of Financial and Economic Affairs? Of course, that is also reflected in the progress report. The management itself, that financial function, is reinforced with 20 men and women, or with 20 FTEs. This is not only the case with the management of FEZ, but also with the different policy directions. Within this programme, which, as I said, is about structural security, we are also looking at how the whole department is aware of the importance of all of this. I think you will also see this in the figures for 2021, because a really big step has been taken. That, of course, affects the culture of the entire organization, in all ministries. Against the same backdrop, there was the question: what about the masks of Sywert van Lienden? Were they in the 1.7 billion? No, that is not about purchasing personal protective equipment such as mouth caps, not even Van Lienden's. However, the Court noted that errors and uncertainties in corona-related expenditure amounted to some EUR 1.7 billion. Of these, 1.5 billion are self-tests delivered and laboratory tests analysed. In addition, there was insufficient control information to determine the products or services supplied in full. This was not, therefore, the purchase of personal protective equipment. Again, the further approach to the control function within VWS is working hard to improve this aspect. Then you could say: yes, but perhaps it concerns the 200 million? No, the remaining 200 million is concerned with the absence of a bank guarantee for the provision of an advance. Then the grant scheme corona lanes in the care. Is it being properly evaluated? I have to say quite frankly that it has not yet been decided on how VWS is going to evaluate that subsidy scheme, because it is still under way. The deadline is now 30 June 2022. As soon as more information is available, the Chamber will be informed. As you know, we are also working on a broader letter on labour shortages. The insights about this subsidy scheme are also included. Then there is the question: will proper procurement be considered when preparing for a new outbreak? Yeah, absolutely. We are also doing this by already launching calls for tenders to be sufficiently prepared for all possible scenarios. Mr. Chairman. Then there are a few other questions. One question was about the sustainable development goals, the so-called Sustainable Development Goals. As you know, we have embraced it. The problem is, however, that they can be better anchored in our entire policy. I still think so. I know that we have both made an effort to see if you can use this much more as a cross-cutting red thread. That's a little tricky. I think we should work on that. The problem... What I want to say here is that it is a coherent, universal agenda, but you have to be extremely careful that we not only consider it to be something that goes abroad and that we do not have our own system once you cross the border. No, it must of course be anchored in our own thinking and working. The SDGs are embraced worldwide as a shared plan to secure both human well-being and prosperity for the future. These are very important issues, not only for what used to be the third world, but also for the whole world, including the Netherlands. We have now asked the PBL to check where there is a trade-out between climate policy and the SDGs. An example of this is SDG 7, about water and everything related to it. The public report of the PBL states that the SDG agenda is mainly synergistic, even if you apply it nationally. So we are playing into that, even if there is a risk of exchange, for example, I would just mention one biofuels that compete with the food supply. That's what we're trying to prevent. There is another letter on it from, I think, the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation. At least that letter's from the State Department. Then there's the question of power inequality.",True,0.029,0.849,0.122,0.9994,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-09-tweedekamer-8,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 90, Session 8 (2022-06-09)",2022-06-09,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 8,Meeting 90,Sitting 2022-06-09,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,MarkRutte,"Rutte, Mark",M,1967,55.0,False,6
257,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-14-tweedekamer-27.u7,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are interested. It is a great honour for me to give my maiden speech here for you as a Member of Parliament; a position I had not thought of two years ago. And working flexibly on the subject, which my predecessors have already said a lot about. It is really a subject that we have had a lot of experience with over the past two years, but also for a long time. Born and raised in Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland. There I grew up, together with my sister, in a sweet and safe family in which freedom, looking after each other, but above all responsibility was the norm. My parents had a company in facility business, but they also found volunteering really important. I remember the summers very well, which were the basis for what I did in the future. Because because of the crowds in the company in the summer we never went on holiday. So I've been working for three weeks since I was 15. I've actually done that a little earlier, but I can't officially say that in the case with my parents. But I was also three weeks lifeguard on the most beautiful beach in the Netherlands, Zoutelande. From that beach we took care of the safety of the many bathers along the coast. Working with your parents in those three weeks and earning a penny was very common and never a discussion. I've never known working hours from eight to five. On the beach we started, like here, around 10:00. But the end time was also very stretchy. And that for a fee of €12,50 per day. As a member of the rescue squad, I provided various training courses and trainings to get enough volunteers on the beach in summer to take care of the safety of the bath guests. This went from performing first aid and finding a lost child, or the parents, to saving drones at sea. And that on a stretch of beach that seemed very safe for everyone. But the sea-going vessels are very nice to feed at less than 100 meters away along the rubber boats, swimmers and surfers. The current was also heavily underestimated. What has made a very deep impression on me is the commitment to the floods in Limburg in 1993. Just before Christmas we urgently had to take the lifeboat from Zeeland to Limburg, in the night hours around Baarlo to get people and animals from homes and farms. That's what we did the next day in Venlo. This was repeated again in 1995. The harrowing situations you encountered will always be with you. Many experiences of this commitment I later used to provide input for the renewal of our rescue fleet. The fact that I later became a security expert and made my work out of my hobby isn't going to sound weird to you. Furthermore, I also went to work in the company, in which I also shaped the quality policy and safety policy in addition to the execution at different locations and with specialist assignments. I also advised a lot of companies in metal and wood on their VCA routes. That's very nice, because you just look at others in the kitchen. When my parents asked me to take over the company from them, I did this. My father mainly gave me to take good care of our people, because that was the foundation of the company. With 150 employees, it was a really big family. My political interest started early, but never got active, until nineteen years ago my good friend André Bosman asked me whether or not I was strict, as my wife said for a sounding board group of the local VVD. One thing led to another: from political assistant through council member to group chairman. As you can see, André has been back with my wife on a regular basis. For the last ten years, I've been allowed to be alderman in Middelburg. The choice to do this at 47, you don't make it alone. After good consultation with André, but especially with my wife and certainly with my mother I said goodbye to the company and started this new challenge, with a very diverse portfolio. In particular, social affairs was very special for a VVD worker. I liked that, because here my entrepreneurial spirit, but also the safety part really came in handy. Changing a classical social service and a classical social employment provision into an integrated work-learning company was a great achievement. In addition, it made a lot of contact with residents and entrepreneurs until a time I wouldn't have missed. I think you'll recognize that. My starting point was and is that you have to work on the basis of trust, with open sight and willing to consult. My experience in the regulation is precisely that one assumes: trust is good but control is better. It's often counterproductive. Safety policy in the workplace is also very closely regulated, so that workers no longer think for themselves and sometimes work very counterproductively. Rules must help workers and employers and not make this impossible. Fun in your work, being allowed to think along and heart for the cause just have to come back. Mr. Chairman. Last Friday I visited such a family business, PDL, a large family business, which works with many employees in various innovative sectors in the Netherlands and beyond. Their basis is strength through cooperation. By ""cooperation,"" they mean above all: with their staff. This creates a stable, growing, flat organization, which is really their strength. Here in the House of Representatives, too, we really need to see together that we radiate more power if we work together on the basis of trust. I'd like to work on this, too. Mr. Chairman. Now, with the above experiences, I come to the initiative proposal, but before I go into that, I would like to thank the initiators very much for their commitment to their proposal and for the great work that has been done on it, because I can really imagine that. Over the past two years, homework has determined the working lives of many inhabitants, as the predecessors have also indicated. This has produced many positive experiences, but also comments. The desire of the initiators to provide more certainty and continuity is an understandable consequence of this. For the VVD, particular attention is given to the usefulness and necessity of the law, the administrative burden on SMEs and social cohesion within the company. The VVD is particularly keen, based on confidence, to ensure that employers and employees work in good cooperation with each other in an appropriate way for site-independent work. With last Thursday's letter of amendment, which fully endorsed the opinion of the ESC, we see that this cooperation between employer and employee takes shape. In particular, the explanation of the initiators with regard to the ""reasonable"" and ""fair"" is crucial when weighing up a homework request. In this context, I would like to ask the initiators a few questions. Firstly, on the usefulness and necessity of the law. The Council of State found that a critical point. Why has it not been chosen for a period of two years to see whether employers and employees can arrange for themselves? How is social cohesion in companies? It appears that many workers cannot or cannot work at home because of their work. Could the proposers explain the terms'reasonable' and 'fair'? For example, for which professions is it possible or not to do so, all the bus driver and the care were called ""to grant a request""? In what way is the balance between the interests of employer and employee sufficiently secured by this proposal? Finally, Mr President, our SMEs: the family businesses. They are the strength of our economy, where employees belong mainly to the family. Why is the qualitative administrative burden burden not taken into account as a review framework in the evaluation, whereas the Advisory Committee on Control Pressure, the ATR, does advise this? Can the proposers promise that this will happen? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.

258,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-15-tweedekamer-4.u10,"Madam President. Millions of Dutch people are in a deep financial crisis. They're being brutally abandoned by this cabinet. Pensioners, people with benefits, people with jobs and families often don't make it anymore. Inflation is skyrocketing and everything is becoming more expensive: the groceries, the energy bill and the price of petrol and diesel. It's priceless. A few weeks ago, I asked people who had a hard time financially to send me their story. There has been a massive response to that. The reactions are heartbreaking. What suffering in the Netherlands and what financial misery. I will tell some of these stories here today and make concrete proposals to help those people, because that is really not the way to go any longer. Mr. Chairman. For example, a lady writes that she hasn't been to the dentist for three years, turns the heater to 17 degrees if it's fresh and can't buy a flower if she goes to the cemetery to visit her husband's grave. A couple with two children whose husband is working full-time and the wife part-time writes to me that after paying the fixed charges they have so little left that they go to the food bank weekly. And a lady who works in home care writes what she encounters with her clients: people with rheumatism who don't have money to turn on the heating when it's cold and who stay in bed with a thick scarf all day long; people who soak up their detergent with water for longer; people who put their sick pet to sleep because they can't pay the vet's bill anymore. Or the lady who writes to me that her energy bill has risen from €200 to €550 and that she can no longer pay the monthly contribution of €500 for her husband's nursing home. ""I really don't know what to do anymore,"" she writes desperately. Or the gentleman with heart failure, who didn't want to join the ambulance at first, because then he would have to pay his own risk completely. Or the lady who e-mails that she is chronically ill and has to choose between medication and food, because both are too expensive. Mr. Chairman. Or the couple who already sold half the furniture at Marketplace to do groceries. And then the 93-year-old gentleman who, he writes, has worked hard all his life and who now has €25 a week left to do groceries. He's incredibly angry at the Prime Minister and says he doesn't have enough money to live on, but just too much to die on. Or the working mother of two sons who, because of her income, gets no supplement, but also doesn't draw from her salary. Or the gentleman with only AOW, who can't afford it anymore, who can't take it anymore and who doesn't want it anymore. He didn't get his meds from the pharmacist because he had to pay for it. But he couldn't pay extra. He had to pay extra, but he didn't have the money, so the gentleman went home without medication. I'm getting goosebumps that this is happening. Or the family that can no longer pay the fixed costs and especially the energy bill and only buys old bread from the bakery and eats cooked macaroni three days a week. Or the former military with PTSD who says to be guessed because he can no longer pay the travel expenses to his treatment, his therapist. ""The common people are breaking down, Mr. Wilders,"" he writes to me. Or the 79-year-old man who only has AOW with a small pension of €30 per month and who almost runs out of savings. He hopes, he writes, that this way he won't make it to the 80. Mr. Chairman. This is the Netherlands anno 2022. Mrs Kaag and Mr Rutte should be ashamed to let this happen in a wealthy and prosperous country like the Netherlands. Surely it is too insane for words and not to explain that they are spending up to 100 billion dollars on asylum seekers, nitrogen, climate and development aid, but they are suffocating our own people. It is even so bad that asylum seekers are now housed on luxury cruise ships, while many Dutch people are not even able to go on holiday anymore. What D66 circus did we end up in? What kind of crazy priorities are these? Our purchasing power, our farmers, our care, our homes, our pensions: everything is destroyed. By slavishly jabbering Prime Minister Rutte to Mrs Kaag during the negotiations for this cabinet, we are now in some sort of toxic D66 dictatorship. Do you find it strange that 82% of the Dutch no longer have confidence in the cabinet? Only 18% of them trust the cabinet. A decent cabinet should be working day and night, day and night, to help solve the Dutch' financial problems. That should be priority one, two and three. But that is not the case. Mrs. Kaag and Mr. Rutte fly themselves in luxury planes from Davos to Washington and other places in the world to have a good time there and enjoy five-star hotels and expensive dinners. They themselves know the word ""crisis"" only from the newspaper. They have no idea how much of our population is suffering. We have a Prime Minister and a Deputy Prime Minister who have been totally disenchanted from the reality of ordinary men and women, from millions of Dutchmen. That's terrible. Mr. Chairman. I have put forward six concrete proposals in six amendments to improve people's purchasing power this year. Only spend EUR 10 billion less on nitrogen policy and more on our people. My first proposal is to reduce rents by 10% from 1 July. My second proposal is to set the low VAT rate at 0% temporarily until 1 January, so that messages are affordable again. My third proposal is that fuel taxes on petrol and diesel should also be set at 0% temporarily, so that a litre of petrol will be at least €0.65 cheaper. My fourth proposal is to set VAT on gas and electricity at 0% so that people can pay their energy bills again. My fifth proposal: increase the energy surcharge for people with a narrow scholarship to €1,200. And my sixth proposal: increase income support by €25 per month for those many people with only a small supplement. That's not too much to ask, is it? A lot of people have been helped. Mr. Chairman. This is a much-needed and realistic plan, which we can help millions of people this year, so that they can get their lives back on track and get a different perspective from the bitter poverty that Kaag and Rutte have in store for them. I hope they will think this through.",True,0.084,0.835,0.081,-0.5208,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-15-tweedekamer-4,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 92, Session 4 (2022-06-15)",2022-06-15,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 4,Meeting 92,Sitting 2022-06-15,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,PVV,Partij voor de Vrijheid,Opposition,Right to far-right,GeertWilders,"Wilders, Geert",M,1963,59.0,False,6
259,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-15-tweedekamer-4.u31,"Thank you, Mr President. We're talking about the Spring Note today. The word ""spring note"" sounds awfully Haags, but that's not really it at all. The Spring note and everything below is about proposals from the cabinet to solve problems for people at home. A number of problems that arose shortly after the coalition agreement was concluded are the purchasing power of the government. We discussed this for a long time in the declaration of government with the elderly, a tax setback, a ruling by the Supreme Court and, of course, that terrible war in Ukraine. It is part of politics that we respond to current events and that we solve and deal with new problems that are on our way. That always means we have to make choices. If you work with four parties, compromises must always be made. That is the only way forward. The VVD Group welcomes the fact that the cabinet really has a number of major problems with this Spring paper. For example, it is proposed to increase the AOW with the minimum wage. I can't believe we're solving the problem of that tax breaker. That we are implementing the ruling of the Supreme Court on box 3 and responding to that terrible war in Ukraine. Of course, we do this by helping Ukraine humanitarianly, with military support, but also by investing more in our defence, in our security here in the Netherlands. Solving those problems also costs money. For the VVD it is also important that we handle our finances neatly. Even though less spending is always difficult and painful, we are satisfied that the cabinet also chooses to do so. Mr. Chairman. In the whole package there is one thing that really stands out for the VVD, namely the extra money, the extra investment in defence. For our safety here in the Netherlands, for the safety of the Netherlands in Europe and for those who are committed to the safety of our country. 2 billion more on top of the additional 4 billion a year in this period from the coalition agreement: together, the largest investment this cabinet makes. An investment for which my group has negotiated hard is also a much-needed investment. It is necessary, because the war in Ukraine has pushed everyone with its noses on the facts. How important is it, then, that with these additional investments, we can offer a higher wage to the people working in the Defense Department? How important is it then that we give these people the right equipment to do their work on exercises or during stakes? Mr. Chairman. For the first time since the Wales pledge agreements and for the first time since 1995, we are investing another 2% of our economic expenditure to protect our country.

At the same time, the situation in Ukraine is really at a turning point. It is crucial that we do more. That is also what I would like to ask the cabinet: much more weapons, the absolute edges of the possible search, the Dutch aid, so to speak, double over the next few weeks, sell stuff through third parties, supply weapons through allies, virtually empty our own supplies.

No taboos means no taboos. There is a line which Mr Van Dijk is right to draw and which draws the Foreign Minister, but I think it draws the whole Chamber. That is the line that there should be no direct confrontation between NATO and Russia and that the threat of the Third World War should be avoided. The way to do that is to give Ukraine maximum military support in their fight against Russia, but not directly involved by NATO.

We see that the war in Ukraine is an intensive sprint, but at the same time it is becoming a marathon. On the one hand, we come from one crucial stage in which there is a fierce struggle in the other, but on the other hand, unfortunately, the end is not yet in sight either. On the one hand, therefore, I support Mr Sjoerdsma's motion: we must continue to see how we can do the best we can to support Ukraine by military means. At the same time, however, we must also look further ahead, because this war is probably not over in a few months and we must also be able to provide military resources in the medium and longer term. That is why I also asked the Minister to pay attention to this and to look with his colleagues in Europe at how we can increase our European arms production, so that we can give Ukraine not only in the coming weeks, but also in the coming months and perhaps even years, the best possible starting position vis-à-vis Russia. Secondly, I would like to express my appreciation to the Minister for migration. Not only Ukraine is on the agenda, but also Egypt, the Horn of Africa and agreements with the Gulf States. These are all regions in which there is instability and large flows of refugees. And it is also a real task for our minister, with his contacts, to secure agreements on migration, so that we can get a better grip on this and do something structural about the asylum crisis that the Netherlands is now dealing with.

It can only be that it is no coincidence that the entire public gallery is full. This is also different during a two-minute debate. I appreciate that, too. Mr. Chairman. I am going to do it briefly, because that is what a two-minute debate is meant for. I will also refer to the debate we have had with each other on a number of issues. In the direction of Mr Van Dijk, I am going to repeat what I said yesterday afternoon, yesterday evening and just now, namely that I greatly appreciate his perseverance, but that, weighing everything up, I am doing the short, short version of the debate, the motion in part No. 2497 would be dissuaded because we do not think this is the gremium to bring closer to that goal that Van Dijk and I share, namely a nuclear-free world. So, with reference to the further argument in the debate, I would like to discourage that motion. The second motion by Mr Van Dijk, on item No. 2498, I would like to give a ruling to the Chamber, but with the comments I made in the debate. I have outlined that this is an extremely complex playing field and that the Netherlands has not managed to continue along the path of further research into war crimes. Moreover, I have outlined that the situation in the Human Rights Council is extremely complex. But since I do agree with the need to make an effort, I'm going to give the motion judgment chamber. We will also take action on it, but I want to be realistic about what the Netherlands can do at those specific meetings. Then, Mr President, the motion in part No. 2499 by Mr Sjoerdsma. I would like to repeat a few things that Mr Sjoerdsma himself said and which have also been reported in the event of interruption. I very much agree with the broader port of the motion, which is, by the way, embedded in the broader discussion we have with each other on how to help Ukraine in full width. This is about the military aspect, about sanctions, about humanitarian aid and so on. Here is the specific question of what more you can do in this very difficult phase of the war. The comments I would like to make are firstly about that word 'taboo'. I can't wear taboo on my own. By the way, that doesn't mean you're gonna do everything. You then start to weigh time and again what is wise and what brings the two goals that we have set ourselves closer. One goal was to equip Ukraine to maintain its own sovereignty. And two was to ensure that the conflict does not escalate further and does not lead to much greater misery in the region and possibly even further away. The second comment, which was also made by a few of the spokesmen, is that the cabinet really takes a positive stance here, but will also have to relate to readiness. At the same time, I really share the port of the motion. With these comments, we all know that they will then be part of the history of law.

265,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-21-eerstekamer-7.u220,"Thank you, Mr President. I wanted to move on to the cup of quality. I wanted to start with Senator Recourt's questions about truth in times of progressive digitization. In his speech, Mr Recourt referred to the value of relevant facts, of the truth for the rule of law. I think this is an important point. I'm aware of that, but so is the government. I also think that we should be vigilant about the impact of the digital transformation of society on this issue, including the legal system. Digitisation is a reality. How does the legal system relate to this? In the European context, for example, when discussing the proposed regulation on the digitisation of the justice sector and access to justice, this is also a focus of attention. Let's look at the contents. The establishment of the relevant facts contributes to legal certainty. For example, you can think of the transfer of property, but also the prosecution and trial of suspects for criminal offences. Then we're talking about justice. Even then, facts play such an important role. I think it's legally relevant to know what those facts are. That is exactly what the cabinet is doing. We have asked the WODC, the Scientific Research and Documentation Centre, to do research on deep fakes, for example. At the request of the House of Representatives, research has also been carried out into immersive technologies, which are truly permeated by... For example, you have augmented reality. Well, I don't think I should go into that. In all these investigations, the key question is whether we as a government are well equipped to deal with the emergence of these new technologies. I'd still like to zoom in on the criminal trial. There really needs to be permanent attention to validation of sources. I know that the Dutch Forensic Institute has recently expanded its knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence. This means, for example, that the authenticity of documents can be verified at all times. Then I zoom in on the legal professions involved in digitisation. I am thinking, for example, of the notary. Many legal services are changing under the influence of social, but also technological developments. IT plays a role in this. Specifically about the notaryate, I can inform you that a bill has been submitted to the House of Representatives to enable the digital creation of an e.g. We are also looking at how the notary's role in the physical world can also be made possible in the digital world in order to establish identity in legal traffic. This is precisely why we also gain experience of the changing role of the notary and how it will develop. I also expect that this digital transition will emerge in the investigation into the state of the notary I have promised to the House of Representatives. I expect this will start through the WODC this year. The one about digitization, Mr. Chairman. Let me see if any more quality questions have been asked; that is the case. Questions have been asked by the Christian Union about the introduction test. In this context, a question has also been asked by the SP about a risk-regulation reflex. The VVD also asked questions about the introduction test. I combine all the questions asked in the answer I have to give now. The SP rightly mentions the risk-regulation reflex and the introduction test together. Of course it is an important instrument. With the introduction test, we create a new feedback loop to improve learning ability in policy. In this way, we are working towards an ever better quality of legislation. This is just a first check. Shortly after the introduction of new regulations, we actively look for the first signs of how it works in practice. How does it work for the target group and for the public service providers? We're gonna look both ways. Earlier, I indicated my introduction that it is too soon for a comprehensive evaluation. You'd have to get more experience for that. Of course, if you encounter pressing bottlenecks, you have to look for appropriate solutions and space within the rules. If the regulation is to be adapted, we must do so, but in good cooperation between politics, policies and implementation. This is also the first step in the introduction test. As far as I am concerned, we should not look for it in instruments such as perseverance, but in administrative and political will and power to correct mistakes and unintended effects. Then there is the guarantee of legislative quality. Then I come to the people who have to do it. In my triangle people also play an important role: structure, culture but also management. Mr Backer asked the question and I therefore endorse the message that it is very important for the state-wide legislative quality that the legal function is well embedded in the ministries. In order to promote this, on 24 March 2021 the Prime Minister established the designation of the legal function of Rijk. These apply to all ministers and secretaries of state and to persons working among them. What's in those clues? The instructions state that the Director of Legislation and Legal Affairs has direct access to the directors and the Secretary-General of the Ministry. The indications shall also ensure that the Director of WJZ participates in relevant consultations with the political and administrative summit and receives the necessary information. In order to promote compliance with the instructions, the Director of the WJZ of the Ministry of JenV reports annually on behalf of the other Directors of WJZ to the Secretaries-General on the quality of the legal function of the State Service. This in terms of the human function to ensure the quality of legislation and regulations within the departments. Mr. Chairman. When I talk about quality, I also deal with the theme of the execution test and its ability to do so. GroenLinks has asked questions about this, but also the VVD. You referred to the Klem report between desk and policy, and you asked if there was sufficient cooperation with implementation, including in the light of receiving signals about doping power. As a cabinet, we recently received all the major implementation organisations and with them also explicitly opened the dialogue. That good dialogue must be about what is considered feasible and not feasible. Regulatory accountability is also provided by default in the explanatory memorandum, including in the case of negative opinions from implementing organisations. Should we raise the bar? Yeah, you have to learn, learn, learn and improve every time. We need to make sure that we work much more closely with implementation organisations and make good policy. We are going to strengthen this even further by involving implementation organisations at an early stage and looking with them at enforceable and manageable rules. I can mention the Work on Implementation programme, but you know that I am also working with the integrated balancing framework. I think that's important. The integrated balancing framework actually addresses seven key questions. What's the reason we're doing what we're doing? Who's involved? What are we talking about? What's the problem? What's the target? What justifies government intervention? What is the best instrument and what are the consequences? These are basically the key questions in the comprehensive policy and regulatory framework that is being used. Mr. Chairman.

It concerns the period from 1945 to 1949. And if not, whether the government is prepared to achieve that accessibility. Not all archive documents relating to the war operations of the Netherlands in Indonesia during this period are fully public. This is mainly because of the protection of privacy. But the archives are accessible under certain conditions. For example, researchers can access these archives for historical scientific research, such as the research of the NIOD, the Royal Institute of Language, Land and Volkenkunde and the Netherlands Institute of Military History. Those investigators have been given access. I didn't actually get any signals from them that it was difficult to access these archives. If Mr. Nicolaï has heard other sounds, I'd like to hear them. Then there is Mr Backer's question. He asked about the commitment to Mr Pijlman on research into ways of combating disinformation in public service broadcasting. My predecessor has indeed promised Mr Pijlman to investigate whether there are sufficient possibilities under the Media Act to counter disinformation in public broadcasting. This question is taken into account in the policy review media. It will examine to what extent the current legal national and European public service policy instruments are still appropriate, given current developments in fake news. Your Chamber will receive the results of this policy review. It will be completed in November of this year. Mrs. Nanninga asked for a definition of fake news. The cabinet uses the following definition of disinformation. Disinformation is the deliberate, mostly secretive, dissemination of misleading information with the aim of damaging or disrupting public debate, democratic processes, the open economy or national security. It is not primarily up to the government to assess whether there is disinformation. That does not relate well to freedom of speech. I therefore do not go into separate reports. Mrs Nanninga has indicated that her group is also concerned about disinformation. It has argued that it is necessary to combat disinformation in a completely transparent manner, without political arbitrariness. I agree with her. The Netherlands also advocates this in Europe when it comes to measures to combat the spread of disinformation on their platforms. Let me do a small part. Ms Nanninga mentioned several topics, including Russian disinformation. I'm guessing she went into the media sanctions with this, too. An important reason for these sanctions is that the broadcasting of these channels poses a direct threat to the security of the Union and that these channels are instrumental in fueling and justifying aggression against Ukraine. The reasons for these media sanctions were therefore broader than merely spreading disinformation. Then I have one final answer to a question. Mr Rombouts today asked about the impact of journalists' publications on the rule of law. Of course, journalistic publications can have an impact on the rule of law. Just look at the impact of the revelations about the supplemental affair or the documentary The blue family that has recently appeared, and what all that does. As Secretary of State, I'm at a distance from the journalistic work. That distance is also how it belongs to the law. The sector itself has a high degree of self-regulation through drafting regulations, journalistic codes, ombudsmen and the Council for Journalism. Over the last few years, I have spoken to journalists and editors who also consider this self-regulation important for their work. In my future meetings with the sector, I would like to discuss with them how they view their impact on the rule of law.

267,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-21-eerstekamer-7.u327,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased with all the answers that have been given and also with all the answers that have not yet come, if I may believe the Minister. We've been talking here all along about learning ability. I understand from Mr Rombouts that we still need more learning power ourselves. What does learning power mean, for my part, when we talk about the rule of law? I have tried not to think in a block spirit but to keep my first-term speech on ethics and the link between ethics and law and the rule of law. I just wanted to take a look at that whole thing. Learning power is also: look back. You look back at what went wrong. I looked back. That was also because the NIOD came up with a special report on how we acted in Indonesia. In my view, if you really want to take responsibility as a rule of law, you should look not only at what went wrong but also at what has been done. How would you describe these actions in terms of justice? Are those crimes, maybe? That is very important for the awareness of good and evil. After all, we all need to maintain and develop that. I think the rulers will agree with that. In that context, I had asked a question about something horrific that has happened in a distant past: the actions of Prime Minister Colijn. My questions as to how the Minister views them, and whether they have not been ordinary crimes in current terms, crimes against humanity, have not been answered. I would also have asked: and if you have also received a Willems Order for those crimes, doesn't the Minister think it should be withdrawn? I would like to have an answer to that in this period. Well, let's talk about the rest of it. I have also asked a number of questions about the Indonesian War of Independence. I understand from the Minister that there will be another letter from the government. There may still be some discussion about this. But I'm inclined to say: let's give the minister some homework. I have two motions on that point which I would like to table. The first motion is next.

271,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-4.u33,"I'll get back to the Balkans later. I do think that steps should be taken there too. As regards the Balkans, for example, the EU has decided to put Albania and Macedonia in the same basket. At first there were bokkades on Albania all the time, including from the Dutch government. So North Macedonia couldn't join. Then those blockades were gone, including those of France. Now there is another blockade of Bulgaria in Macedonia. With the situation in the Eastern Partnership, with the war, the invasion, from Russia, which has already taken military raids in all these three countries, I find it incomprehensible that you are not treating these three countries in the same way at the moment. So I think the answer is yes. Mr President, I shall continue. A region that is at least as important is the Western Balkans. It is important that a positive signal should be sent to these countries next week, also because support for the EU among the population in those countries is declining rapidly. Albania and northern Macedonia are the victims of the cumbersome way in which we take decisions in the EU. Skopje's been a candidate for 17 years. But the negotiations have still not started, because of a veto by Greece, and now one by Bulgaria. The Prime Minister has travelled to Bulgaria before, but what more does he want to do to convince Sofia to lift his blockade? Another positive signal that the Heads of Government can finally give is the granting of visa-free travel to the Kosovars, as the last country in the region. Since 2018 that country has met all technical criteria and there is no objective reason to exclude Kosovo from this. In fact, the current European Commission, led by Hungarian Commissioner Varhelyi, is doing everything in its power to promote Serbia. New chapters have even been opened with Vučić, while the rule of law is under increasing pressure. In this light, it is high time that the Council made a gesture to Kosovo. Is the Prime Minister prepared to commit himself to this? Mr. Chairman. It is a bit uncomfortable that EU leaders at the EU Summit want to focus on developing plans for the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the war there is still raging in all intensity. What the Ukrainians now need is more weapons to defend their country and new sanctions against Russia. Unfortunately, sanctions are not on the agenda. I'd like to hear from the Prime Minister if he's willing to push for a seventh sanction package. I just heard two coalition parties refer to that as well. The draft conclusions also cover the recent renewed tensions between Greece and Turkey. That is understandable, given the very aggressive tone of President Erdogan and other Turkish politicians vis-à-vis the Athens government. As Turkey's rapporteur for the European Parliament, I spoke a lot with human rights defenders who complained that EU leaders were not making enough statements about developments in Turkey itself, such as the dismantling of the rule of law and the lack of freedom of the press. This seems to be the case again. I know the Prime Minister shares these concerns. Is he therefore prepared to raise this at the meeting with his European colleagues? Mr President, I will conclude. The step to offer Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia the European perspective is very important, but our credibility in the Western Balkans is really at stake. If, quite rightly, we demand strong reforms from candidate countries, then the EU must also keep its own promises.

272,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-4.u109,"Thank you. I too would like to begin by welcoming the three ambassadors of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to our Parliament and to this debate. Mr. Chairman. Tomorrow is the last EU Council of the French Presidency, a presidency which was long awaited and which has been very active. It is, of course, particularly marked by the war in Ukraine. An aggressive superpower invades a sovereign country, commits war crimes and puts hunger as a weapon to the rest of the world. After almost four months of war, the battle is still as fierce. It remains impressive to see daily how steadfast and combative the Ukrainians are. It reiterates the importance of a united and effective European Union. We saw this unity in the first months of the war, but we also see it under increasing pressure. Our vulnerabilities, such as dependence on Russian gas, oil and grain, are becoming increasingly exposed. We will therefore have to invest more in the coming years in increasing our strategic autonomy. We need to reduce dependence on Russia and China in particular and strengthen our own economic and military power. I would like to ask the Prime Minister how he views the EU's strategic autonomy at the moment. How does he assess the steps that have been taken in recent months? What do he think are the most important follow-up steps? Does the Prime Minister agree with me that reducing these strategic dependencies for Europe is one of the major challenges for our foreign policy? Mr. Chairman. The European Union faces major challenges. The most acute of course remains how we can continue to support Ukraine as well as possible, both humanitarianly, financially and militaryly, and that we can continue to increase pressure on Russia. In doing so, rising prices and the pressure on purchasing power are making it increasingly complicated to maintain consensus, for example on new sanctions packages towards Russia. A country like Hungary is currently frustrating every major decision. How's the Prime Minister looking at this? Does he see any solutions to this? Is there any discussion at the forthcoming Council about additional sanctions against Russia? If so, in what direction? What is the Prime Minister's position on Lithuania's decision to partially ban rail freight transport to Kaliningrad? As far as the VVD is concerned, we must maintain sanctions against Russia consistently, but at the same time we must prevent this sensitive issue from escalating. Does the Prime Minister also expect a discussion at this Council on additional military support? As far as the VVD is concerned, there is a creative view with other EU countries of how we can continue to supply arms to Ukraine. At the same time, we need to ensure that we can continue to do this structuralally in the longer term. Does the Prime Minister see the possibility of a structural increase in the production of arms in Europe in the coming years? Mr. Chairman. Last Friday, the Commission delivered its opinion on the accession of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. The Commission recommends that both Ukraine and Moldova should be granted candidate membership, but that additional conditions should be laid down before the actual negotiations begin. Of course, given the geopolitical situation and Russian military aggression, the VVD understands the value of European perspective for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. Rather, these countries have been given a clear signal that they belong to the European family. However, they have indicated in many ways how important it is for them to formalise this signal. They need this perspective in their daily struggles, but also for all the reforms they need in the coming years. From their position, of course, that is understandable. At the same time, the VVD has always expressed hesitation as to whether this is an appropriate time to grant candidate membership. This is because of the rule of law, the degree of corruption and the economic situation. As a result, Ukraine is still miles away from actual membership. It will take years, if not decades, before the country meets the criteria. The VVD welcomes the fact that the Dutch Government has highlighted these concerns throughout the process in Europe, and has not only looked at the symbolic value of granting candidate membership. We also see these concerns in the Commission's opinion. Additional requirements have been made before negotiations can begin. As a result, the concerns about corruption and the rule of law are being addressed. Moreover, this is consistent with how we dealt with other potential candidate countries such as Albania and northern Macedonia. We therefore support the commitment and attitude of the cabinet. However, the VVD would like to know from the Prime Minister how harsh the conditions that have been set are actually. How and by whom will this be monitored? Who decides whether these conditions are met? Are and will continue to be a precondition for the start of the actual negotiations? For the VVD it is essential that these conditions are not washed nose. There must be no shortcuts in the further route. The full instruments of the enhanced accession procedure, including by the Netherlands, should also be applied to Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, including the pause of negotiations in the event of insufficient progress.",True,0.055,0.836,0.108,0.9932,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-4,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 95, Session 4 (2022-06-22)",2022-06-22,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 4,Meeting 95,Sitting 2022-06-22,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,RubenBrekelmans,"Brekelmans, Ruben",M,1986,36.0,False,6
273,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-4.u132,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, a warm welcome to the ambassadors of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. Volt is pleased that the Netherlands has declared itself in favour of Ukraine's and Moldova's accession to the EU and Georgia's future accession to the EU. For Ukraine, it is an important signal that it is part of the European family. The same applies to Moldova, which, in the context of a very difficult situation, is undertaking reforms and can now take this step. However, these three countries will have to undertake major reforms in the coming years. I am curious how the Netherlands will support them, to prevent it from becoming a hopeless process, achieving the opposite of what is desired. I am pleased that colleagues have also drawn attention to this. I am therefore curious to see what the positive and negative lessons we have learned from other countries are. How's the cabinet gonna take it? For the sake of time, I agree with the questions that have been asked earlier about arms supplies. I was wondering what else the Netherlands could do about this. Security in Europe is an important issue. It was also discussed in the previous European Council. At the end of this month there will be an important NATO summit in Madrid. I have a few questions about this, because the European Council will probably also discuss it. In anticipation of the Madrid meeting, I would ask the Prime Minister to urge his colleagues to provide structural military support to the Baltic States. They fear that, regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, Russia will regroup, strengthen and attack the Baltic States at an unguarded time. Fortunately, NATO is already working on Gotland, but the Suwalki Corridor is also a possible target. Is the Prime Minister prepared to argue in favour of strengthening the permanent defence of the Baltic States? Mr. Chairman. Today I would like to consider the consequences of the war on the food security of countries, particularly in North Africa and the Middle East, but also in relation to the long-term relationship with the countries there. The blockade of the Black Sea, a terrible act by Putin, has a huge impact on the food market. The same applies to the hoarding of animal feed and the positions held by the market players, as Mr Van der Lee said just now. The SWIFT sanctions of Russian banks have also made grain and maize scarce and expensive. In the annotated agenda, the Prime Minister focuses in particular on reopening the Black Sea route for the export of grain from Ukraine. Colleagues have already asked some reasonable questions about this and I agree with that. Earlier in a debate, the Prime Minister indicated that he and his associates had no idea whether the SWIFT sanctions also had an impact on Russian grain exports. Does the Prime Minister have a clear idea of the consequences of the sanctions on food security? Is this being discussed in order to ensure that this is prevented as much as possible? Does the Prime Minister understand the precarious situation of the African Union, especially in relation to the European Union? One reason I ask is that we need the African continent, because we are competing with China for access to critical raw materials for the energy transition. I'd like a reflection on that. China started hoarding grain in December, driving up prices. This is an opportunity for Europe to show what our European values are worth, not just by focusing on Russia's share in the food crisis, but by making global food security in general a spearhead and seeing how the European Union can contribute to this. Is the Prime Minister prepared to press his colleagues at the summit for a European food security plan in Africa? Mr. Chairman. The impact of the war is becoming more palpable, even in the Netherlands. Gazprom is pumping less and less gas into the European gas network. This not only makes gas more expensive, but also makes it more difficult for all European countries to replenish their gas reserves for the coming winter. More and more countries, including the Netherlands, therefore choose to scale up the use of coal power plants. At the same time, I am concerned about whether we can maintain unity and solidarity in Europe at the moment when there is a real reduction in gas supply. The IEA warns that we need to prepare ourselves for a full stop. There is talk in the agenda of a European contingency plan. What does it say? What is the Minister's position on a European gas disposal plan? What steps are being taken and what are the arrangements? Does the Cabinet believe that agreements should be made if several countries actually have a gas shortage in the winter and households may be without heating? Just in times of crisis and uncertainty, the ability to maintain solidarity and justice determines the resilience of a society. This applies to the Netherlands, but certainly also to the European Union. Mr. Chairman. Finally, I would like to make a very small point. Rising inflation is not only a Dutch challenge, but also a European challenge. Last week, the ECB met for urgent consultations to discuss the impact of the interest rate step. The differences in interest rates between countries are increasing. These rising spreads were an important stress indicator during the euro crisis when investors questioned the survival of the euro. I wonder whether the Prime Minister will also discuss this with his colleagues at the European summit, in order to prevent this from happening.

274,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-7.u2,"Mr. Chairman. For my part, too, I would like to say how wonderful it is that the ambassadors are present. I'm glad we can do that. Like you, I am a guest here, but from one guest to another I say: welcome! A lot of questions have been asked. I want to start with Ukraine and Moldova. Then I would like to address a number of specific questions about Georgia. Then there are the general questions about enlargement. Then there is the Western Balkans. Then there is the Ukraine-Russia war. Then there's food security. Then there are a number of questions relating to the Conference on the Future of Europe. Then there are a number of vague people who have to do with the euro and the Stability and Growth Pact. A few other questions, including the questions about Northern Ireland, strategic autonomy, Poland, RRF, Turkey, Greece and structural military support for the Baltic States. So all these questions come in the closing cup. Mr. Chairman. First, the enlargement of the EU and the European Commission's decision to recommend granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, at least to the European Council. The Netherlands was concerned, let me just say, that there was too much need, an almost compulsive need, to necessarily give Ukraine and Moldova that status. I understand that this is the explanation for the voting behaviour of a number of parties with regard to motions for resolutions on this matter. But in the meantime, of course, there are new developments. A new development is that we have urged the Commission to be brutally honest, especially to look at matters such as the rule of law, independent judiciary and rule of law, and to come up with a very precise assessment. So no political judgment. Do not say: there is a war and so Ukraine must become a candidate. No, the system of expansion needs to be maintained and it needs to be based on performance. Then, of course, it is always a matter of weighing. Last week, in the course of Wednesday or Thursday, we received signals from the European Commission that it would indeed be a very strong opinion on the content, but it would be, all things considered, coupled with an even longer list of actions for Moldova, a proper list of actions for Ukraine and for Georgia such a long list of actions. But the other two: candidate member. We discussed this in the Cabinet with the ministers concerned and then on Friday throughout the Council of Ministers. We said, in the end, you have to agree with each other. It's always a weighting: where is it exactly? But we are actually saying that the Commission has done a good job. I think it is handsome in the sense that there has really, sincerely, been an attempt to identify exactly what the situation is and that it has been said: listen, friends, it is now a candidate, but the actual opening of chapters will again require a unanimous decision, also on the basis of progress on these seven points. That will, of course, come up again sometime this year, or, more likely, next year when that issue is before us. I found this signal now, in a weighted, acceptable compromise between all the views of the European Union... I'm also saying this as a politician, as a professional. We are all professionals here, to a greater or lesser extent. Others have to decide if we really are. But I think the Commission has done this well. Is that a turn? I don't think so. I leave it to others to decide for themselves. I think there's plenty of evidence that if I have to make a spin, I'll just admit it. Look at my exceptionally successful intervention on dividend taxation. For example, there are a few points in my recent political past that I am really prepared to give in. But I do not think that is the case here. So it's not a word game. Mr. Chairman. Against this background, a number of questions have been asked. I'll answer those questions first. I say this because Mr Van Dijk, who just got up, might otherwise think: is that the answer to my questions? No, I'll come back to that. To begin with, there was the question whether the Netherlands was able to agree on additional conditions. I don't know. We have said to the Commission: be brutally honest. As I know, the Commission has not said: this is what we intend to do; is that enough? We have always called for clarity in the assessment. I have to say they did. I don't know if it's us. In the Volkskrant, one of the journalists said that he had information that the Netherlands had influenced this. Well, then I'm very proud, but I don't have any hard clues that that's true. Then there was the question: did the cabinet speak with one voice? Yes. I can't always do that. But we are all looking at what the Commission is coming up with with with an open eye. How harsh are these conditions, asked VVD member Brekelmans and others. In my view, it is important to note that the Commission itself says: this is crucial. They need to make enough progress on those seven points. They're gonna monitor it. This is done annually by means of an annual progress report. Of course, we're also going to keep our finger on the wrist through our embassies. The Commission's conditions are conditional on a further step in the negotiations. Then there is the question of whether it is actually an empty gesture. No, I honestly don't believe that. But I get the point about Brekelmans and I'll get back to that when we talk about the expansion system. It is, of course, now a large number of countries. Turkey has been engaged in talks since the late 1990s, when the European Union did not even exist. I think that was at the time of the European Community. Since 2004, as I recall, the chapters have also been opened. The Intergovernmental Conference then took place during the Dutch Presidency. That was 18 years ago. On the other hand, Croatia has been relatively fast. So that's kind of different. I'll get back to you on that. You must, of course, ensure that it does not lead to disappointment or that slowness leads to a kind of acidification. That is a real point. It can't be solved in one go. The PVV says: but there was that association agreement and you said that it was not about accession? I said that, and I'm still saying that. The point was that in that association agreement, the advocates of the no-vote argued for four reasons why you had to vote 'no'. That was quite consistent and this was mainly reflected in a television broadcast between then group chairmen Samsom of the Labour Party and Roemer of the SP, I say by heart. We then said that Roemer has so clearly articulated those four points. One of them was that it would be an addition to a membership. It wasn't. We have once again recorded in what, somewhat disrespectful, is called ""the insert."" That, of course, is not the right legal term. I'm saying by heart that in the end we even got six points in that piece. One of them was the reconfirmation that it wasn't a prefix to a membership. It was. That's right. That association agreement is independent of membership. Did I possibly say at that time that I never see Ukraine becoming a member? That could be very good. If I'm quoted like that, I'll take it. However, I would point out that geopolitical relations have been very different since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So the more fundamental question about being, at all, the principal, for or against, has been different for different people since February 23, possibly for myself and others too. Then there were all questions about the association agreement. I treated him with that. If this is not a goat's path to membership, Mrs Van der Graaf asked for it. I don't think it's anything like that. This is also confirmed by the Commission in its opinions in the past, and I have laid down this in a new methodology, starting with the rule of law. That was the French-Dutch intervention at the beginning of 2020, in order to end up shooting at Albania and northern Macedonia. Then we said, ""Let's start with the rule of law chapters."" If they then slide back, if steps are taken back during the further negotiations, then you can also take steps back in the whole process. We're gonna monitor that closely. The Kamminga/Amhaouch motion is relevant for that. I hope I pronounce the name right now. I have had quite a training this morning, because I misread that name at the last notation meeting. But the Kamminga/Amhaouch motion is leading in this respect as far as we are concerned, and the embassies will also help. No, Article 42.7 does not apply to candidate countries. That was a question from Mr Van Dijk. A country cannot be at war to become a member of the European Union, but it will not become a member of the European Union. It is a question of membership, and this requirement does not apply. Of course, it must be re-examined if there is real accession, if it is to come to that. Of course, there is now the common ambition to achieve this, but it must be possible. Then access to pre-accession support. This calls for a separate decision to amend the regulation. The Commission must put forward a proposal for this. Then space must also be found in the MFK. That is not yet the case. It might be obvious, you might say, because why does one country and the other as a candidate? But basically it has to be within the existing pots. We are therefore waiting for that proposal. As soon as it's there, we'll provide it with a judgment and send it to the Chamber. Once again Brekelmans, VVD: how do we ensure that countries are not frustrated? I have already replied: we really need to ensure that the dialogue on reforms takes place properly, that if things are not going well, that we also talk about it openly and that we indeed support Ukraine and Moldova in their enlargement ambition. I also said yesterday in contact with Maia Sandu, the President of Moldova, that we are already active in Moldova with programmes; we will continue to do so. The same goes for Ukraine, of course, I said on Friday in a telephone conversation with Minister of Defence Ollongren. This also applies to the fact that we are also ready on our part to help prepare the country further, but that will simply take a long time. It is a huge journey that Ukraine must now go on and the next station is starting negotiations. Then it is really important that that progress is made on those seven points. Mr. Chairman. The one about Ukraine. Then I come to a number of questions on enlargement in general. No, about Georgia, because I'd like to do that separately. I have a few more questions on enlargement in general and on the Western Balkans. There is, of course, a connection between this issue and the Western Balkans, but I thought: so many questions have been asked, I will split it up for the moment.",True,0.031,0.846,0.123,0.9996,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-7,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 95, Session 7 (2022-06-22)",2022-06-22,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 7,Meeting 95,Sitting 2022-06-22,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,MarkRutte,"Rutte, Mark",M,1967,55.0,False,6

Because you saw, of course, after the war, whether it was in the GDR, in Prague or in Budapest, or in Bucharest, where the then party chief, in the late 1960s, was trying to give the impression that he was heading his own course, which is not really true either. But what you see, of course, is that Russia - which manifests itself in '56 and '68 with the suppression of revolutions and also in '82 in Poland - in the form of the Soviet Union was oppressive in that part of Europe. That's the military alliance. In addition, there was the Comintern, which tried to export wider than just Europe, which was also world-wide, the internationally functioning socialism. Of course, it is not the case that the ECSC was merely a reaction to that. The ECSC was set up to prevent another war in Europe from arising from the idea that coal and steel are the most important raw materials for a war. The idea was of course: if France and Germany manage these products together, they can no longer attack each other.

276,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-7.u78,"It has been asked to add anti-corruption sanctions to the regime, or to set up a separate anti-corruption regime. During the negotiations on the EU's human rights sanctions regime, we advocated the inclusion of corruption as a listing criterion. At the time, there was insufficient support for this. A separate EU sanctions regime against large-scale corruption is now under consideration. We are in favour of this. That is what we are actively promoting in the discussions. My statement on ""our war"" is, of course, just as some Members of Parliament have said, not meant that we are literally at war. It means that this is a fight that is directly about how we want to defend a civilized country like Ukraine against uncivilised aggression and how we want to contribute to it. It's also about how you stop this type of aggression, because it would get some ID if you didn't. We have also said that we want to prevent NATO from coming into direct conflict with Russia. Of course, it is important that a peace agreement is reached in the long term, but it is now up to Ukraine to decide when and under what conditions these negotiations will take place. Of course, it is important that Ukraine has the best negotiating position until that negotiation comes. That is why we are doing everything we can to help Ukraine. I certainly expect discussion at this European Council on how we can continue to support it, including military. You know our position: maximum support for Ukraine and maximum pressure on the Russian Federation. This includes military support, in line with the Sjoerdsma/Brekelmans motion on maximum deployment last week. That was confirmed this week by Wopke Hoekstra, the Foreign Minister, at the Foreign Affairs Council. On 19 May, I said something about arms supplies. That was very much about the discussion about the armored haters and that there is a limit to what you can deliver to very heavy equipment. That's not black and white. We have to look at that over and over again. That is therefore a case-by-case assessment. Sometimes we bring it out and sometimes we don't. It also depends a little on what's wise in that. We keep looking at what's necessary and what we can do. It is true that in the end there is also a limit to what you can deliver yourself. Luckily, we're not there yet. The European Peace Facility allows Member States to support Ukraine in the military field. It now covers some 2 billion, including 160 million for non-lethal aid and 1.84 billion for lethal aid: fuel, medical equipment and protective clothing. What you see now is that this package is almost exhausted, but at the same time Ukrainian needs are still very high, while the course of the war is still unpredictable. We want to continue to support Ukraine as long as necessary. That is in line with the wishes of the Chamber. So we'll be watching again in the next few days, and otherwise soon, how to proceed with the ESPF. As a result, Mr Brekelmans asked about the possibilities for a structural increase in the production of arms in Europe. I agree with the ambition in his question and also with the need under that ambition. The European Commission has put forward proposals for this. This can be done, for example, through improved cooperation in joint procurement of defence capabilities. We keep saying we need the best stuff. That could also be non-European stuff. Very important to the Netherlands remains that small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from the arms industry. The Sjoerdsma motion is a stand-alone policy, as I have already said. I have already replied that we are always looking at what we can do. As we are now handing over armored haters to Ukraine after training. The question is: are you prepared to veto a memorandum or understanding on energy cooperation between Israel, Egypt and the European Commission? No. We support the EU measure to reduce dependence on Russian oil. That is also what the new REPowerEU strategy is about. EU-Israel cooperation is frequent and enshrined in an EU-Israel association agreement. This MoU fits in there. Then there is Mr Sjoerdsma's question as to whether we are prepared when the gas tap closes further. I think this crisis makes it clear that we need to reduce our dependence. This has been at the top of the European agenda for months. This is also underlined by Russia's recent behaviour. This means playing the whole organ: accelerating the energy transition, energy saving and diversification of energy suppliers. Of course, this was also the subject of the letter of inquiry on the situation in the Netherlands, which was sent on Monday in connection with the press conference of the Minister for Climate and Energy and the Secretary of State for Mining, Mr Jetten and Mr Vijlbrief. This is the stage of the so-called early warning, where filling the European gas storage for the coming winter is very crucial. The Netherlands does not oppose the joint procurement of gas. We did say this had to be voluntary. So no obligations. This has to do with the fact that the European gas market is very complex, with a lot of players, and compulsory procurement can lead to problems. Then there's the oil transport ban. With the last sanction package, it is prohibited to cooperate as an EU company in any way in the transport of oil to third countries. A ban on oil transport insurance has also been adopted by parties in the European Union. We are now talking to partners inside and outside the European Union about how we can make it even more difficult for Russia to make money from oil exports to third countries. We would be in favour of a seventh sanction package. We must also pay attention to the EU unit. The previous sanction package, the sixth, was not easy to achieve, as you know. We must also ensure that the measures are effective and that the measures we have already taken are implemented as effectively as possible. However, we call for continued preparations for such an additional sanction package. I think we should also establish, I say to Mr Van der Lee, that sanctions will only be effective if we take them at EU level. This also has to do with the functioning of the internal market and the agreements on the division of roles in Europe. Mr. Chairman. Two more questions on this point. We were asked what opportunities we see to contribute to the reconstruction of Ukraine, such as adopting a city. We've talked about that before. We are very much in favour of strengthening urban links with Ukraine. Of course, the responsibility for this lies with the UNG. We are now working on the preparations for a Dutch contribution to reconstruction. A debate on this will take place on 7 July with the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, Schreinemacher. These issues will also be further addressed. Finally, I come to Kaliningrad and Lithuania. Unlike the Russian claim, there is no overall blockade of persons and goods to and from Kaliningrad. Lithuania complies with the sanctions policy agreed within the European Union. That could be the case. There's no way to predict that. Anyone can raise anything. But it is not explicitly on the agenda of tomorrow's European summit and the day after tomorrow, I say to Mr Van Dijk.",True,0.059,0.819,0.123,0.9976,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-22-tweedekamer-7,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 95, Session 7 (2022-06-22)",2022-06-22,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 7,Meeting 95,Sitting 2022-06-22,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,MarkRutte,"Rutte, Mark",M,1967,55.0,False,6
277,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-5.u65,"Thank you, Mr President. Digitisation is a blessing, but digitisation can also be a terrible curse. It's a blessing if it makes our lives easier, but a curse if it increases inequality between people, if it creates an impersonal government that only a computer can talk to. It's a curse when algorithms become monsters that discriminate against people. Mr. Chairman. We must cherish the blessings of digitalisation, but we must always avoid digitalisation becoming a curse. This requires guarantees, safeguards in the area of preventing discrimination. After all, we all know what can happen if you let algorithms and digital systems run their course. Then you can be considered a fraud by the government based on your origins. Then you are taken out as an older person with a migration background and checked extra. Gifts to mosques are then classified as suspicious transactions. And then some creepy fraud score cards are used. Do you live in a trailer? Extra points, extra risk. That's disgusting. Thousands of people have fallen victim to this. This must never happen again. We therefore always ask the government in this kind of debate: do not categorically ban the use of origin, nationality and ethnicity in the risk models. Is the government finally prepared to do so? The Secretary of State has promised DENK that she will see how she can make safeguards against discrimination and algorithms binding. My question to the Secretary of State is: does she know how she is going to do this? When do we see the result of this as a Chamber? As far as DENK is concerned, there will simply be a law as soon as possible in which we will lay down these guarantees. At this point, I am considering a motion. Mr. Chairman. How far is the Secretary of State with the mandatory human rights test on algorithms following an approved motion from this Chamber? There are also several European initiatives on the regulation of algorithms. Think of the AI Act, for example, but also the Digital Services Act. If I take a first look at these initiatives, I find the safeguards it contains against discrimination and human rights to offer little concrete and insufficient security. Amnesty International also says this. Does the Secretary of State share this observation? How can it still use influence at European level to further strengthen the requirements against discrimination in these European regulations? On this point, too, we are considering a motion. Mr. Chairman. We're going through the government right now on discriminatory algorithms. Like Mrs Leijten, DENK thinks that you should stop using algorithms when you don't know whether or not algorithms discriminate. I would like a response from the Secretary of State why she is always unwilling to do so. Mr. Chairman. I will also continue to ask this Secretary of State why she is not prepared to perform an external test on that screening. Because the same government that has discriminated with algorithms is now going to check whether or not those algorithms discriminate. The butcher approves his own flesh. Why does the Secretary of State not want an external review? Mr. Chairman. During the technical briefing, I noticed the following. The step is missing to investigate how a possible discriminatory algorithm has been created, who is responsible for it, and to hold the people responsible for it. Why is that the case?

278,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-5.u75,"Mr. Chairman. Digital technologies will make an important contribution to solving the major societal issues of the coming decades. This is feeding 10 billion mouths, combating climate change, providing quality care in an ageing society, precision agriculture, sustainable energy supply, accessible care. Digitisation is indispensable here. But we also see the shadow side of digital technologies. American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote a depressing article a few weeks ago about the role of social media in society. A healthy democracy is based on three main pillars, he writes: social capital in society, strong institutions and a shared story. Social media have undermined all three, is his gloomy analysis. Mr. Chairman. We can look at digital technologies in three ways. Some of these views have just been shared in the Chamber. The first is an optimistic, instrumentalist view. Technology is then an instrument by which we as people can achieve our goals. We are free to use these technologies and we use them if they are useful to us. The second vision is a pessimistic, deterministic vision. Technology is not an instrument, but an autonomous force that can control us. We are no longer in control of this, society has become a technical system and we are the victims of it. But there is also a third perspective, one in which we ask not so much whether a technology is right or wrong, but above all how we relate to technology. The question then is this: does technology contribute to man as a responsible, free and creative being or does it undermine human dignity? What are the consequences of technologies for the good living together of people? Mr. Chairman. The CDA looks at digital technologies in this way and the following principles are guiding us. First of all, that every person counts. Digitisation must not lead to new divisions in society. Secondly, digital technologies must not suppress ordinary human practices. If technology undermines human dignity, takes the place of ordinary human contact, dissipates good living together and undermines our democracy, then we must stop. Mr. Chairman. From this point of view, my group would like to ask the following questions about the cabinet's outline letter. I shall begin with the most concrete point. Many parents struggle with the question of how much screen time they should give their children, what apps and games they may or may not allow and at what age. Many parents then run into children being manipulated in these games to do all kinds of micro transactions. Especially the so-called loot boxes are a thorn in our eye. Loot boxes are a kind of treasure chests that game developers have added to games. Kids are being manipulated to buy these loot boxes, but it's unclear what's inside. So it's a form of gambling and it's also addictive. It saddles families with unexpected, high bills. Last month, together with 20 other consumer organisations from 18 European countries, including the Dutch Consumers' Association, the Norwegian consumer association called for this. In the Netherlands, the Gaming Authority already imposed a penalty charge on the producer of the FIFA game in 2019 for these slot boxes. Unfortunately, however, this statement did not stand up at the Council of State. In Belgium, loot boxes in video games are now banned. Mr. Chairman. The CDA Group wants you to put an end to these loot boxes. By ""you"" I don't mean the chairman, but we want the cabinet to put an end to these loot boxes. Children and families should be protected from this. Period. I will table a motion on this. My second question is whether we are currently doing enough to protect vulnerable children on social media. An example. A few weeks ago, TikTok shared a naked video of an underage girl being bullied. Only after the video had been watched thousands of times and several reports had been made, TikTok deleted the video. The CDA Group hates that, because this girl has been damaged her entire life. Why do we allow this as a society? How can we intervene in this? That's what I'm asking this cabinet. Then there's my third question. It says whether we are doing enough in terms of technological citizenship. Good citizenship means that we have not only rights as citizens, but also obligations. The focus in the current debate is on civil rights, such as privacy and accessibility. But should we not also pay much more attention to the duties that we also have as citizens? Europe's strategic autonomy is once again high on the political agenda as a result of the war in Ukraine. Also on the topic of digitalisation, strategic autonomy should be the starting point. For example, it is not acceptable for Chinese companies to provide ICT for crucial energy infrastructure in the Netherlands. That is why we ask the Minister of EZK how she will place Europe's strategic autonomy in its digitalisation agenda.",True,0.093,0.806,0.101,0.6512,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-5,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 99, Session 5 (2022-06-30)",2022-06-30,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 5,Meeting 99,Sitting 2022-06-30,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,HenriBontenbal,"Bontenbal, Henri",M,1982,40.0,False,6
279,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-5.u147,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unlike the speakers' order on the list, I'm going first. I also have another debate where I am going for a moment. Mr. Chairman. Digital matters is a broad subject, which has been with two D66 speakers since the beginning of this year. I am talking today about a digital budget, cybersecurity and digital civil rights. Colleague Dekker then takes care of algorithms and social media. Mr. Chairman. D66 is pleased that we now have all the cabinet plans in one place in the main letter, but the next step is the financial side. In 2013, a D66 motion arranged for the budget to have an overall overview of all the BES budgets, for our Caribbean islands. We have a motion to achieve the same in the digital field, so that in the autumn we can have a debate on the digital spending of the entire cabinet and the Chamber can carry out its controlling task properly. I would like to ask the directors to respond to this idea. Mr. Chairman. Last month, we talked about cybersecurity. So I don't want to say much about that right now. However, I would like to say that it is very important that we keep our society safe from digital interference and that we protect our knowledge-based economy from our prosperity. So it is good that the cabinet will invest more, but more money is not enough. D66 believes that we should stop the fragmentation of our digital resilience and have a much wider-functioning National Cyber Security Centre that helps protect all companies and organisations in our country. My question is: when is that a fact? Mr. Chairman. Then there are three points concerning digital civil rights. Firstly, laws that use or propose personal data are created on the conveyor belt: PNR, House for Whistleblowers and Truck Charges. Collecting more data is not always better, especially if the supervisory capacity of the Dutch Data Protection Authority is left behind. That's what I call a sneak-out. D66 welcomes the catch-up investment in this cabinet's AP, but it does not solve this problem in a structural way. Can the Cabinet therefore undertake to include in each legislative proposal, with a collection of personal data, the additional supervisory capacity of the AP for this purpose? Second. Finally, my motion seems to be arrested to protect the addresses ofzzp'ers, such as journalists, in the Trade Register. In anticipation of the final law, the Minister wants to allow sole proprietorship cases to include a mailbox as a physical address. That sounds good, though I have a few more questions. I'm making one of those now. When canzzp'ers do this? Can we do this in the short term? Mr. Chairman. I am aware of the time, but Mr Dekker and I have agreed on a slightly different relationship. So I will continue with the next point. Mr. Chairman. Then facial recognition in public space. That is a major violation of our rights. Fortunately, the European AI Act is going to restrict this considerably, but that regulation is not yet in place. As far as D66 is concerned, this means that facial recognition should be proactively suspended. The government promised no facial recognition in the coalition agreement without strict legal demarcation and control. My question to the Minister of JenV is therefore where facial recognition is still used in public space, why, and when it is suspended. I'll leave it at that. My colleague Hind will discuss the other subjects.",True,0.067,0.826,0.107,0.9734,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-5,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 99, Session 5 (2022-06-30)",2022-06-30,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 5,Meeting 99,Sitting 2022-06-30,-,"COVID,War",English,Regular,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,LisaVanGinneken,"van Ginneken, Lisa",F,-,,True,6
280,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-5.u151,"Mr. Chairman. Our democratic rule of law and our way of living together cannot exist without our shared values, values such as human dignity, equality, freedom, responsibility, charity, but also space for difference. This also applies to the subject of digitalisation. New technologies are coming at us at a rapid pace and are increasingly affecting our physical, biological and social-cultural world. Artificial intelligence, algorithms, big data, internet or things, the cloud, quantum computers and robotics: all this also affects children's lives. Digitisation inevitably affects public values. The Chamber plays a role in securing those values. Make no mistake: technology with proper guidance will make lives better and close gaps. If we don't steer this properly and seize it properly, technology can also make gaps bigger and it has the power to destroy societies. It can enlarge the gaps between rich and poor and the haves and the portot, and can make gaps bigger for future generations. That is precisely why the Christian Union is considering these guiding values. We'll have to talk to each other in front. My group welcomes the fact that the cabinet is aware of the importance of value-driven government policies in the digital transition, by formulating their own values and committing to them in legislation, the cabinet strategy and research. They must also serve public values in digitalisation, we read. Mr. Chairman. But when I read what the Secretary of State has formulated as public values, I find them, quite frankly, even lean. She calls security, democracy, self-determination, non-discrimination, participation, privacy and inclusiveness. But this is not explained further. I also miss a number of values that we as a Chamber broadly share. I also mentioned these values at the beginning of my speech. So this is not enough for my group. I am addressing this precisely because from now on we are really going to steer towards the different technologies that are coming towards us. Also on the content, I think that the values are missing something. I miss the eye for simplicity and the eye for vulnerable people. I miss the desire to do the utmost to use technology in such a way that it supports the most vulnerable in society, but also that technology can be used for innovation and easy to control. I therefore think that this should be looked at more fundamentally. There must be a more fundamental debate on these values before we allow them to lead the decision-making process on digital developments. Is the Secretary of State prepared to come up with a separate letter in which she elaborates on these values and to which the Chamber can then relate more broadly? Mr. Chairman. I just reported the following, too. It is important for the Christian Union in the next period how we deal with children's rights in the digital environment. What additional steps are we going to take to protect children? I have three proposals for this. One tool that can help is the Code of Children's Rights. What is the Secretary of State doing to get companies to actually use the code? What else can she do to implement the code? Mr. Chairman. The second point is the child impact assessment, whereby digital services are required to account for the digital impact on children. How is privacy guaranteed? How are children protected from exploitation, but also from digital bullying? How do you prevent children from getting in touch with harmful content? Mr Bontenbal just gave the example of those so addictive loot boxes. Many digital services are really not doing enough about this right now. Is the Secretary of State prepared to introduce a legal obligation to such a child impact assessment? Mr. Chairman. The third point. We have just talked about harmful content such as extreme violence and child pornography. I would also like to dwell on that. Last month, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly discussed a resolution on this issue, specifically on protection against pornographic content. The resolution has been discussed and adopted, with recommendations for the Member States. Can I ask the Cabinet to come up with a letter this autumn, which deals with the analysis of the Assembly and the recommendations made to the countries? Mr. Chairman. Finally, accessibility. In order to settle matters with the government, you need to use a website or application more often. However, many government applications are inaccessible if you can see poorly, are less digitally skilled or have learning difficulties. This leads to exclusion of these groups of people. The law therefore requires governments to publish an up-to-date accessibility statement for their apps. But Stichting Appt concludes that only 1.25% of the estimated nearly 600 government apps are inaccessible. In addition, information on the accessibility of hundreds of government apps is lacking and it is unclear exactly how many unique apps the government has. This has to be better.

281,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-8.u2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good indeed that today we can discuss the issue of digitalisation in response to the main letter sent by the government in March of this year. It is a development and a transition with an incredible impact on all of us. A number of you have already said this: the current digital revolution offers great opportunities for our society and our economy. The cabinet also wants to take advantage of these opportunities, from a strong starting position. Because thanks to our excellent infrastructure, the Netherlands is in a leading group of EU countries in terms of digitisation. At the same time, and some of you have already said a great deal about this, we must not close our eyes to the risks. Think of data leaks, disinformation campaigns or the 20% Dutch people who do not have digital basic skills, and who cannot participate in that digital society. Digitalisation thus contributes to growing inequality. These things can put pressure on our security, the rule of law, democracy, people and fundamental rights and our competitiveness. It is therefore so important that this government recognizes that we are in charge as a government. By playing a driving role, we can shape the digital transition in such a way that it fits the important and characteristic Dutch values, such as security, democracy and self-determination. It is the task of this cabinet to ensure that our world becomes as safe, inclusive and viable online as the world offline. Of course, I do this together with my fellow executives, whose core team is also present in this Chamber today, to work on a serviceable digital government, in a connected digital society and with an innovative and innovative economy, with solid rules of play, supervision, more strategic autonomy and a leading role in Europe. With these European rules, such as the Digital Markets Act, we restrict the market power of large platforms so that more opportunities are created for our SMEs and for others, and we ensure that there is freedom of choice for citizens and that they are protected. For example, we do the same with the Digital Services Act and the AI Act, the law on artificial intelligence. They protect our human rights and democracy. After the summer recess, we will publish a work agenda, as already announced in the main letter. In it we indicate exactly what activities we are going to perform in the coming period. That's an agenda we're making together with the cabinet. It indicates what we are going to do with the government, what we intend to do for our society, our economy and other themes, such as the Dutch cybersecurity strategy. In this work agenda, we will talk, among other things, about digital identity, accessibility, e-government and the protection of citizens. We also want to introduce this widely and, of course, discuss it with you. Today we are doing this mainly on the basis of the outline letter. The first block deals with the coordinating role. A number of questions have been asked. I have the task of working with the cabinet, together with my fellow executives, on the digital government, a connected society, a digital society and also an innovative and innovative digital economy. We need rules for this, such as good supervision, autonomy and a leading role in Europe. That's what it says in our coalition agreement. Then, of course, there is work to be done for a lot of people. Because digitisation plays a role in many of our policy areas, whether it's the work of the government itself and our services, whether it's about security, cybersecurity, or what we want in the areas of healthcare, climate and so on. That will always be work for many. It is, of course, important that we ensure that this fits together and that we have a common foundation on which we want to work, for example in monitoring our human rights and ensuring that digital society is safe, inclusive and viable. Of course, I'll be committed to that. But again, we do that together. In the cabinet, we also said: if we see that it is not enough to make agreements with one another to talk to society to get things done, then we will also not avoid the need for a law or a standard from time to time. It is important to ensure that we achieve what we want, namely a world that is as safe online as it is offline. I would like to answer the questions raised by Mrs Leijten and Mrs Van Weerdenburg, among others. Mrs Van Weerdenburg also asked what is the intention of the next step we want to take. She said, of course, the main letter deals with a number of higher-level intentions and objectives. That is, of course, also the idea of the outline letter. Of course, it is very important that we put this into practice. She is right to point that out. We're gonna show that after the summer. We show what we are going to do, for example, in the area of digital identity. We'll talk about that later. We will talk about the points that apply to the Dutch government. How, for example, do we make our services more bundled? How do we ensure that services can be provided in a safe and sound way? We are going to work on the road maps of the I strategy. So we're going to make sure that the IT of the Empire gets back on track. We do this together and we ensure that it is done in a safe way. We'll make sure our backlogs are resolved. We're gonna work on Red teaming to make sure hackers don't come into our house. It's all that kind of stuff. The state-wide cloud policy certainly plays a role in this.

Number one is that it is important that we set frameworks for algorithms: what can you use them for, what data may be in it and so on and so forth. That's what we do in the Netherlands. We do that in a European context. We are also working on this with the municipalities very much. Municipalities themselves have very good ideas about this, as you say. Next, it is about ensuring that monitoring is organised and that there is a register of the algorithms that are in use. For everyone, it has to be clear how that works.

The aim is to include EU legislation on artificial intelligence, human rights and discrimination as an element in the EU framework, for example in the AI Act. If this can play a role, it will also be tested in those high-risk systems. We'll make sure that happens. If that is not the case, we will look further at it in a national context. Our directive on algorithms, which has been announced in our I strategy, will be important for the tests we are going to do ourselves. That is where the so-called 'human rights test' called 'IAMA', which is also known as 'the 'non-discrimination clause', plays an important role. So the essence is that we want to record this.

I will go to the point about municipalities, discrimination and what we can do to stop it. That was a question from GroenLinks and DENK. It is clear, of course, that discrimination is prohibited, that it should not be and that discrimination should not therefore be used in algorithms. At present, municipalities are, of course, responsible for complying with the law themselves, and the city council must supervise this. What we consider important and where European regulation is not only important is that municipalities also comply with the law and that it is clear what should and should not be done. The aim is, of course, to carry out these human rights tests on algorithms, both in terms of discrimination and other subjects. I am very active, along with the municipalities, in doing so. In fact, municipalities are also very active in ensuring that algorithms or risk models, if they use them, meet all the requirements already in force in Dutch law. At European level, we are very committed to this. That was also one of the questions asked. That is what we are doing, for example, with those regulations on artificial intelligence and, not least, with the work done by the Council of Europe to also make a treaty in the field of artificial intelligence.

288,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-8.u55,"No, I agree. Fortunately, these municipalities no longer use these systems. That's a partnership of a number of municipalities, I believe three. So that's good news. If I'd known they were still using it, I would have. Of course, I feel responsible for this; not least that is why we want to regulate it at national level. That is why I added that to the answer to Mr Van Baarle's question. I would like to continue answering the other questions. Mr Van Baarle asked about the implementation of the Marijnissen motion. I just said something about that. Those analyses and inventories are currently under way. An external test has been carried out by the Audit Service Rijk at one Ministry, namely Social Affairs. My request is to see if we can apply it more broadly. I hope to be able to discuss this with you in the early autumn. Mr Van Haga asked to what extent far-reaching powers under international law increase the likelihood of data being misused and what controls there are. These international regulations and legislation, such as the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, as well as future directives on artificial intelligence and algorithms, are, of course, there to strengthen the position of citizens and end-users vis-à-vis online platforms, in order to ensure that civil rights are used and enforced. It is very important for us that this happens and that values such as privacy and autonomy, the right to be forgotten, for example, are used. That is why we attach so much importance to these agreements at European level, not least because the platforms we are talking about work much wider than in the Netherlands alone. I am therefore not so afraid of what Mr Van Haga says, namely: will we not have a control state? We're aiming at the opposite. We want citizens to be able to use these platforms in a safe manner, where their data are not simply sold out, they do not get information they are not waiting for, or their human rights are otherwise harmed. Mrs Dekker asked about the mandatory disclosure of algorithms, that algorithm registry with which we are working. We have made a first start, but before the end of the year we really want that set up, so that what is in it is clear. Of course, it is important that we take the different elements of these algorithms with us. So we not only describe that there is something like an algorithm, but also how it works, what data is used in it, on what basis those data are used and so on and so forth. Mr. Chairman.

289,ParlaMint-NL_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-8.u85,"You're welcome. I would then like to address Mr Ceder's question about the child impact assessment for digital platforms. This is an issue that has also been very clearly highlighted in our work agenda that we want to focus on, because we consider children's rights to be an incredibly important part of the human rights that we want to guarantee. We have a code of children's rights. That helps developers to comply with legal obligations, such as the economic exploitation of children, so use children's data in such a way that you give them ads, for example, or use these children's data in other ways, or use their market influence. Not only do I think this is important, but it is a good thing that we should further develop this in the design and use of these digital platforms. The European Commission has produced a ""Better Internet for Children"" Communication. The Commission proposes to draw up a code of conduct. I think that's important, too. It is also a good commitment, but we must keep in mind that this is adequately incorporated into the various elements and regulations. Additional legal obligations have already been included in the Digital Services Act. For example, you should not profile children in advertisements and the services should be designed in such a way that they are safe for children. As far as I am concerned, this issue must remain high on the agenda in order to ensure that we continue to protect children very well. By the way, as I mentioned just now in replying to Mrs Rajkowski's questions, we also want to ensure that children are not only protected, but that we also help them to understand what the digital world is, how we can make it safe for them and how you can move safely into it. Then there was Mrs Leijten's request about the Council of State report that we should come up with a response from the government. I had hoped that I could have done that for this debate, but that has not yet been achieved. Nevertheless, my commitment is still here. I'm gonna try to send that to you in the next quarter. Then there is Mr Van Haga's question. It was about being able to say anything, and that should be possible as long as it's not a criminal offence. That is exactly what we want as a cabinet. Freedom of speech is at the top. What's offline is illegal, too, online. We have also exchanged this with each other before. It is, of course, important that we continue to steer that, that we also ask online platforms to send it. We're also going to ask if the online platforms will, of course, meditate on what's happening on the platforms in the framework of the Digital Services Act. But that also needs to be transparent, so that even if something happens, then it is clear to everyone what is there and that, for example, when you as a citizen are tagged by such a platform or otherwise you express your opinion, it is clear how you can resist it. Mr Van Baarle asked whether the government is prepared to introduce a policy that a computer never makes a decision. It is very complicated to say so, but what we have said is that under AI regulations and GDPR we will never let algorithms make decisions if there is no human test behind it. That is what we will continue to do. That is also very important to do. This is without prejudice to the fact that these algorithms must be correct, because we also know that it can be insufficient to have only one algorithm and then a human test; both must be well organized.",True,0.018,0.823,0.159,0.998,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-06-30-tweedekamer-8,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Lower House, Meeting 99, Session 8 (2022-06-30)",2022-06-30,Lower house,Meeting of the 30th Tweede Kamer,Session 8,Meeting 99,Sitting 2022-06-30,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,AlexandravanHuffelen,"van Huffelen, Alexandra",F,1968,54.0,True,6

A programme plan shall also specify what this further cooperation might look like. Let us agree that, if it is far after October, I will update one of the debates we are holding so that Mrs van Ginneken can at least keep a sense of what is happening there. From the VVD came the question when we can expect the work of the Hermans motion. There will be a letter from me and the Minister of Economic Affairs. This will address the ways in which SMEs will be supported to become cyber-safeter and become more resilient. That letter will come in the near future. We aim to achieve this before the summer recess. At least that's our goal. Then I'll be at privacy and the Personal Data Authority. My colleague, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has already said a few things about this. I'll see what's left of me. I had a specific question from D66 about facial recognition. Mrs Van Ginneken said: it is still used in public space. Why and when are you quitting? A clear framework has been agreed in the coalition agreement. Facial recognition may be possible, but this requires legal demarcation and control. That makes sense. It is also important that we take care of this in that way. This means that without the forthcoming artificial intelligence regulation referred to in the question, there is a framework for aid. You should hardly ever use facial recognition in public space. This can only be done in two cases in the Netherlands. It is possible if you explicitly ask everyone for permission, for example when entering a festival. Then you can say, ""Would you like to join us?"" But then of course you also have to offer a dignified analogue alternative, so it's a complicated process to do it that way. That often doesn't work in public space. It is also allowed if there is a legal basis to do so. This applies, for example, to our border control. I think everyone can think of why that is. It also applies to the police. It may use the CATCH system with the necessary safeguards; this is the central automatic recognition technology for ex post identification of suspects. But you're never supposed to put this on just like that. So there are always frameworks. If you put this on, it's to keep our country safe and protect victims. In addition to this, the above-mentioned artificial intelligence regulation will provide for additional control. That is a good thing. However, it will not surprise Mrs van Ginneken that I do not see any reason at the moment to ban everything we have now in the meantime.

I think that is also wise, because often business disputes are also the cause of political disputes and even military conflicts. There is an improvement over a lot of criticism of ICSID. I refer to the fact that arbitrators are appointed by the parties. They'll be looking for a third together. Here is a panel designated by both countries; each points to five.

295,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-11-eerstekamer-3.u141,"That's how you can see it, but I'm just gonna assume the wisdom that comes with the years. So maybe he's gonna surprise us. Mr. Chairman. CETA is a mixed treaty that evokes mixed feelings. Thanks to the Brussels comrades, we have nothing more to say about a substantial part of the treaty, let alone to decide. The time when we ourselves were discussing our trade agreements and mutual investment with other countries is over. These powers have long been squandered and fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union. Therefore, the part of CETA covered by this EU competence has been in force since 21 September 2017. In this respect, decision-making in the Senate is completely unnecessary. Mr. Chairman. You then wonder why these matters are included in this treaty and are not regulated in a separate treaty. Is this to draw Members of Parliament over the line so that they can more easily agree with that part of CETA that we are still discussing and that several Members of Parliament face fierce resistance? For which Member of the European Parliament can agree to giving away the powers of elected representatives, to sidestep the national courts, or to ignore the Constitution? The fact that this is sensitive is demonstrated by the behaviour of various parties in this house. They prefer to reflect as little as possible when it comes to CETA, despite their lovingly calling the Senate the ""chambre de réflexion."" Mr. Chairman. Of course our merchant spirit loves good export figures. But that also applies to the other party, Canada, which also wants to wear out its products. The latter may well be reflected in the government's policy of bullying away peasantry. The nitrogen crisis, climate change and so on; it has all been reviewed. Despite everything, the farmer plowed through and pushed his products to the top of the world. Many Canadian farmer can be jealous of that. Mr. Chairman. CETA requires Canadian products to comply with European standards, but the pain is in the way of production. How the product is produced does not make any difference within CETA. And what about hormone meat, genetic engineering, animal welfare? According to the Minister, none of this would be on the agenda. Since our government is not even able to prevent abuses in Dutch slaughterhouses, you can honestly wonder how it can control something that takes place more than 6,000 kilometers away. Here in the Netherlands a part of the halal meat simply disappears in the regular slaughter line. It just happens right under our noses. The ignorant consumer, who is horrified by halal slaughter, simply gets it on his plate, because labelling of stunned slaughter now seems to be very complicated. Statistically, imported meat is completely a black box. The statistical trade data do not indicate whether the imported meat comes from halal slaughter. Mr. Chairman. In the meantime, our farmers are severely put behind us by a tangle of regulation, which is the cause of the fact that we are sitting on a stamp with too many people. That stamp isn't getting bigger, but it's getting fuller. In spite of all these obstacles, farmers have invested in animal welfare for years. This is contrary to the Canadian farmers; they only have to do with a voluntary code of conduct. This will allow them to produce cheaper. It is an illusion that Canada will adapt to higher standards. Practice shows that the temptation is great to choose the best earning model. Mr. Chairman. We have seen this before with the batteries that are banned in the Netherlands. They were exported to Ukraine, and then they went back to importing the eggs from the caged chickens. I am not even talking about the massive quantities of Ukrainian chicken meat that are being driven into the Netherlands with trucks full of the Netherlands. Apparently, we are allowed to consume, but not to produce. It is therefore not for nothing that CETA does not provide for the reduction of EU customs duties on chicken meat and eggs. 'Cause we're gonna get that for a little bit. Next up is the pigs. The first step is already being taken: the reform of pig farming. Once the Canadians come up with cheaper products, our products disappear or we have to lower our standards. All animal welfare efforts then go so, plop, the salty sop. Okay, we're getting bigger quotas for dairy products. But can the Netherlands use it? The milk quotas were abolished, remember? However, growing milk production was soon restricted by phosphate ceilings. It is an illusion to think that the nitrogen space that falls free goes to the dairy farmers. The cabinet wants to get rid of those dairy farmers. That space rather goes to building the Netherlands to facilitate the population growth caused by mass immigration. Mr. Chairman. The Christian coalition parties, with the Christian Union first, have the mouths full of production in the region. But after they have extradited the farmers to the higher powers, it is now up to the judiciary. The ratification of CETA opens the door to the establishment of the Investment Court System, abbreviated ICS, which has the task of resolving disputes between Canadian investors and the parties to the treaty. ICS is the bilateral investment court the European Commission is dreaming of. Tasty tests in your own autonomous, supranational legal order: which elite man doesn't want that? Nothing national law. Nothing national judge. It's all being bypassed. Judges, who often have a D66 preference, were initially dismissed by their own D66 Minister Kaag, who, as Foreign Trade Minister, waved the scepter, when it came to dispute resolution. That's what happens when you introduce someone who wasn't a member of your own political party to a ministerial post. Anyway, now a VVD minister gets to finish the job. Find the differences. Mr. Chairman. The introduction of the ICS is the bypass of multinationals to obtain their rights outside the national legal system. It's not gonna end here. The European Commission sees this bypass as the new standard for all EU trade and investment agreements. Say goodbye to government measures in the public interest. If such a measure affects the investment interest of a foreign investor, the Dutch State may simply get a claim. Despite the right to regulate, this can be done, for example, in the case of indirect expropriation or incorrect treatment. Mr President, of course a Canadian investor can go to national courts. After all, the investor is given a choice: either through the national court or through the ICS. The investor will go for the highest claim and where the probability of success is greatest. That is not with the national court, which will place a case in a Dutch context, will look at the broader interests and also tends to lower the claim for damages, as opposed to the court within the ICS, which will place the investment interest, with CETA in its hand, above the general interest, giving companies more rights. Mr. Chairman. Due to the threat of damages claims, there is a good chance that the government will refrain from taking certain measures. Canada itself, after paying $300 million in claims and legal fees, has become poorer and wiser, and for the new trade agreement with the United States and Mexico, apart from an ISDS arrangement, which is also an investment arbitration court. In the meantime, however, the same Canada is not disgusting about putting us on such an investment arbitration court. And what can you expect from a nation that froze the bank accounts of demonstrative truck drivers? Those were their own citizens, for God's sake. Well, that promises something for the future. The Minister indicated that the ICS was not necessary for the Netherlands, but that it was particularly important for investment protection in agreements with countries where national legislation would not provide sufficient legal certainty. Is this the case in the Netherlands? No. Is this the case in other EU Member States? Yes. Conclusion: because other EU Member States are not in order, we must take more risks. Mr. Chairman. Not only national judges have checked, but also various civil society organisations. Not that the PVV-group is getting so hot from that incestuous network of NGOs and other subsidies, but for the PvdA they're hot. It hurts them that this network is being demoted to be a cogent friend of the court as amicus curiae. Amicus curiae is just a sweetener, a pacifier. I am also very curious whether the PvdA Group is going to be content with this, given the previous statements in the media. The relevant PvdA senator indicated that there was an opportunity to strengthen the influence of the NGOs and social parties without tinkering with the Treaty. Another pacifier! Where have we seen this before? By the Ukrainian goat path of Rutte! The big question is which PvdA'ers are going to be the goat of Rutte again. Mr. Chairman. While the Minister has clearly stated that Parliament must not change a letter to the Treaty, the officials of the Treaty Committees may, after ratification, do so. They are allowed to work on the treaty to their heart's content, to take binding decisions and to draw up rules. All this outside the control of the national parliaments and the European Parliament. And in order to rub the parliamentary powerlessness into it, the parliaments will be informed afterwards. Well, that's what I'm talking about. This differs from Article 81 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the adoption of laws shall be carried out jointly by the Government and the States-General. By agreeing to this bill, these powers are transferred to the Joint Committee, which is contrary to Article 81 of our Constitution. Mr. Chairman. There is even more to it in relation to the Constitution. I am referring to the intended handling of the claims against the State. Under investment protection, these are civil claims, which can also be called claims. Article 112, first paragraph, of the Constitution provides that the jurisdiction of disputes concerning civil rights and claims shall be conferred on the judiciary. By accepting a parallel legal system, the ICS, parts of civil law, which fall within the jurisdiction of the Dutch courts, are transferred to international judges. This is also a derogation from the Constitution. In the event that a treaty contains provisions derogating from the Constitution, a two-thirds majority in both chambers is required for ratification. It is therefore not easy to understand that this treaty came through the House of Representatives by a narrow majority. It is therefore to be hoped that the opposition parties here in this House will all be better advised. I therefore call on the Senate, on behalf of the PVV Group, to comply with Article 91 (3) of the Constitution and to put the present legislative proposal to the vote in such a way that it can only be approved by two thirds of the votes in this Chamber. To this end, I shall table the next motion requesting that it be put to the vote before the votes on the legislative proposals on documents. 35154 and 35155.

296,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-11-eerstekamer-3.u375,"Mr. Chairman. Thank you to all Members for the contributions and the questions. Your Chamber is today discussing the European Union's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, better known as CETA, and the Strategic Partnership Agreement which focuses on political cooperation between the EU and Canada. On behalf of my fellow Minister Hoekstra, I will also talk about this strategic partnership agreement, abbreviated SPA. Today's debate is long awaited. CETA and SPA were signed in 2016. The European Parliament approved the Treaties in February 2017. The provisional application of SPA started in April 2017 and the provisional application of CETA subsequently started in September of that year. In 2020, the House of Representatives approved the ratification of the CETA Convention and the Strategic Partnership Agreement, after which discussion started in the First Chamber. In the meantime, a large number of written questions from the members of the BDO Committee of your Chamber on CETA have been answered. Round tables have been organised and stakeholders have been spoken to. I would like to thank the members of the BDO Committee for the careful written preparation of the CETA approval bill recently. Mr. Chairman. As indicated by your Member Koole and several other Members, the current geopolitical situation calls for a mature and effective EU action. In doing so, the EU needs equal partners. Bonds are more important than ever, but they're not for picking up. Canada is in all respects a unique partner for the EU and for the Netherlands and with Canada, in addition to an intensive trade relationship, we share common interests and essential values of democratic principles, human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and good governance. And we share the conviction and commitment to our international, law-based organization and universal values. Canada is a member of the G7 and the G20. It is an active player in foreign policy matters and as a NATO ally it has been contributing to European security for decades. SPA and CETA form the basis for further deepening the relationship between the EU and Canada. Then about SPA. Let me first mention the political and security relationship with Canada, which is the subject of the strategic partnership agreement. Canada is a crucial partner for the EU. Let me give an example of some important issues. For example, Ukraine. Since 2015, Canada has had a military training mission in Ukraine, with which approximately 33,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained in recent years. Since the war, the Canadian military have been brought back from Ukraine. Canada has provided support in many areas since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, including military, humanitarian, financial and cyber. Canada, together with the President of the European Commission and the Polish President, organised the ""Stand up for Ukraine"" global pledge event, in partnership with the international interest organisation Global Citizen. That campaign has given more than $12.4 billion a commitment. In the NATO context, Canada has currently deployed 450 military forces in Latvia as a leading nation in the context of our forward defence, i.e. the enhanced forward presence. The Netherlands and Canada are also very similar in NATO to arms control, in particular nuclear weapons control.",True,0.027,0.821,0.153,0.9958,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-11-eerstekamer-3,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 37, Session 3 (2022-07-11)",2022-07-11,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 3,Meeting 37,Sitting 2022-07-11,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,VVD,Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie,Coalition,Centre-right,LiesjeSchreinemacher,"Schreinemacher, Liesje",F,1983,39.0,True,7
297,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u5,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of the SP groups and the Animal Party, let me also warmly welcome the ambassadors of Finland and Sweden. The legislative proposal now before us has been adopted by a very large majority in the House of Representatives. The expectation is that it will not be any different here in the Senate. With this, the Netherlands will probably never have ratified a treaty extending NATO so quickly. Therefore, these are exceptional times. However, it is a good thing that we do not call this a debate in plenary, but that we reflect on what can indeed be called an historic step. My group certainly still has a number of questions. Listening to the debate in the House of Representatives only recently, but also in view of previous reactions in the media of ministers as well as other politicians and experts, there seems to have been some sort of euphoria about the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO. It is widely celebrated as perhaps the best news since the beginning of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, as a huge strengthening of the alliance. But my group and the Group of the Party of Animals do not entirely share this sense of hospitality. In our view, it is particularly sad and a sign of how quickly the security situation in Europe has turned out to be bad, that these two Scandinavian countries have now clearly considered this step towards applying for membership to be necessary. As we know, the SP and the Animal Party have always been very critical of NATO, especially since after the Cold War the alliance had become an instrument of American intervention policy. This trend became even stronger when NATO became part of the so-called global war against terrorism, with all the disastrous consequences of this, rather than fighting terror, with the so-called 'global war against terrorism', which has caused a great deal of death and destruction. The political groups of the SP and the Animal Party hope that the accession of Sweden and Finland will increase the likelihood that NATO will be protected in the future from this kind of military adventure, that NATO will leave this interventionist and militaristic course and that it will concentrate on its core task, as far as we are concerned, is that the only task is to defend the NATO territory. Does the Minister share that hope? Mr. Chairman. It happened fast. In mid-April, a month and a half after the beginning of the Russian invasion, the Prime Minister of Sweden, Magdalena Andersson, expressed his opposition to accession, as she feared this would lead to further destabilisation of Europe's security situation. But in a few months' time Sweden and Finland have turned and said goodbye to their years of neutrality. In the case of Sweden, I think that was almost part of the national identity. We all know the reason for this historic turn: the unprecedented Russian aggression against Ukraine and the threat it poses, especially by those countries that are so close to Russia and, in the case of Finland, share a border of 1,300 kilometres with Russia. For the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the planned expansion of NATO is a direct reaction to Russia's aggression and imperialist politics, whereas it was rather NATO and the West that were characterized by expansionism. That makes this accession for my group and for the Animal Party, rather always opposed to NATO enlargement, of a different order. But this doesn't mean we don't have any worries. Ensure that a new Iron Curtain is brought down in Europe. Make sure we're on the eve of a new, long Cold War. In an opinion paper in the Financial Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter, leading the prominent think tank New America, warned that an overly rapid expansion of NATO with Sweden and Finland would lead to a deepening of schism between East and West in Europe. How does the Minister view this risk? Does the Minister consider this to be a possible risk? And how can this deepening of schism possibly be partially prevented, or at least partly reduced? How can we prevent the dropping of a new Iron Curtain and prevent the Iron Curtain from being there for years or perhaps even decades? Slaughter did not oppose the accession of Finland and Sweden, but argued against a hasty decision and a pause for reflection. We are not talking about a radical pacifist from the margins of the public debate, but about a former top official and top advisor to Hillary Clinton. The opportunity for this pause, which she advocated, has now been overtaken by political reality. We acknowledge that, too. That does not mean that we should not take Slaughter's analysis to heart. Her concern, shared by our two groups, was that, if we now allow the two Scandinavian countries to join NATO, and especially if we leave it at that, it could lead to a new permanent division of the European continent, and I am probably quoting Slaughter's words now, translated into Dutch, a much bolder and more courageous thinking about how to achieve peace and security in Europe in the twenty-first century. My group believes that the accession of Finland and Sweden to the alliance is inevitable and welcomes them, but we hope that there will still be room for this courage and courage, the courage and courage to think about alternatives to NATO in the long term. The suggestion put forward by Slaughter, who also referred to the words of President Bush in 1981, which advocated a 'Europe, whole and free', is that we should reconsider a new pan-European security architecture. With this, Hillary Clinton's former top advisor argues for something the SP has been advocating for 20 years. As I said earlier in this place, it is a tragedy that we have missed the historic opportunity to forge such a security architecture after the end of the Cold War. Instead, we have received the east expansion of NATO. Of course, I recognise that we cannot achieve this inclusive security structure as long as Russia continues to pursue an aggressive imperialist policy under Putin and ignores all the principles of the previous agreements with Russia, from the Helsinki agreements to the 1990 Paris Charter. But that does not relieve us of the duty to continue thinking about the possibilities of such an inclusive security architecture. After all, that is the only architecture that will make Europe truly safe. I would also like to invite the Minister to use his creativity, courage and courage to think and continue to think, even in these extremely difficult circumstances, about how we can achieve this real peace and security in Europe sustainably and therefore beyond the present NATO enlargement and, above all, think about how we will prevent it from contributing to what Anne-Marie Slaughter and other analysts warn, namely the new Iron Curtain tearing the European continent in two.",True,0.103,0.735,0.162,0.9973,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 14 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 14,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,SP,Socialistische Partij,Opposition,Left,BastiaanvanApeldoorn,"van Apeldoorn, Bastiaan",M,1970,52.0,False,7
298,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u18,"I shall continue my speech, Mr President. The SP Group is pleased that Sweden and Finland have indicated that they do not wish to extend NATO's military infrastructure on their territory, i.e. not permanent NATO troops or the installation of heavy equipment, let alone nuclear weapons. As far as we are concerned, these two countries are sticking to that. That would only deepen the East-West rift, while it would not be necessary for the defence of the NATO territory. Does the Minister agree with me? Does he agree with the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the other members of NATO, when all the countries have ratified, should not urge the new members to expand that military infrastructure? I'd like a response from the Minister. Finally, a few questions about the trilateral deal made with Erdogan to enable this accession. Mr Karimi also spoke about it. My group is still concerned about this. What exactly does the government consider these agreements to be? We also welcome Finland and Sweden because they are such strong democratic constitutional states. Turkey is not at all. You are increasingly wondering, for example because of Turkey's illegal invasion of northern Syria, what that country is still doing in NATO. Can we be sure that whatever has been agreed will always be fully respected the principles of the rule of law and that no pressure will be exerted on the acceding countries to deviate from this even one millimeter in the future? I'd like a response from the Minister. Erdogan claims that there are people out there in Sweden who actually belong in prison. But what about the many people in NATO member Turkey who are in prison there but who, according to the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg among others, do not belong at all and should be released immediately? What about all the political prisoners in Erdogan's Turkey? Can we talk about that, too? Has that been discussed at the historic NATO summit? I'd like a response. To sum up, Mr. Chairman. The Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Party of European Socialists support Finland and Sweden's request to join NATO as a defensive alliance. We therefore support the proposal before us. But we also say that it is our duty with these new allies to do everything we can to prevent this from becoming the starting point for a new cold war, and that, on the contrary, we will strive for a genuine, sustainable European security architecture, in which NATO, then 32 countries, will eventually be able to join.

299,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u24,"Thank you, Mr President. We talk about historical and special times. And that's not ironic. The euro is in decline, the cabinet is tripping from crisis to crisis, inflation is getting out of hand, the ECB keeps pushing money, the energy transition does not really want to succeed and immigration figures break all the records. To the extent of disaster, Putin invaded Ukraine for the second time on 24 February. Experts would've warned me about it. Few believed Putin would really be that crazy. Looks like the dictator made a mistake. Especially when you talk about the first weeks of the raid, you can talk about bath planning, but also about bad execution. It seems that he thought he could quickly take a number of cities, drop the government and install a vassal, such as the Belarusian Lukashenko. Ukraine, however, offered very courageous resistance. In the meantime, the West showed a rare consensus: sanctions, military support in the form of weapons and ammunition, but above all the terrifying force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. All were and are factors that have prevented the full Russian annexation of Ukraine to date. But let there be no misunderstanding: it is NATO that guarantees our security. It is therefore logical that NATO should join Finland and Sweden. As far as JA21 is concerned, these countries are of course welcome. I am happy to say this, also to both ambassadors present here. These countries meet the criteria laid down, as Mr Koole has just indicated. As far as we are concerned, the accelerated procedure can certainly be applied. Membership not only offers them the much-needed nuclear umbrella, but it also demonstrates why we should not use a European army. Finland and Sweden choose the strongest partner to ensure their safety. They do not come here to ask to participate in some semi-imaginary European army. My group is therefore in favour of the proposed extension of NATO Quick Reaction Force proposed by Secretary General Rasmussen. The security of the European Union and its countries and the security of the Netherlands and its allies depend on the strength of NATO. That's why Putin has been so miscalculating. As a result of his invasion, he got an upcoming NATO member state on his Russian borders. This was precisely when he wanted to prevent Ukraine from tying itself more closely to the West and thus giving Russia a western threat at its borders. Putin knows that NATO is the great power of the West in the military sense. Sweden knows that, Finland knows that, and my group knows that. That is why we will always argue for the minimum 2% of GDP, not only in promises as made in Wales, but in real doing and delivering now. I would like a reply from the Minister as to whether he agrees with our group. Finally, Mr President, my group is also in favour of rewarding the good and punishing the bad. We are very curious to see what arguments and instruments are being used to ultimately convince Turkey to agree to these two applications for accession.

300,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u36,"Mr. Chairman. The 50PLUS Group welcomes the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO. I also welcome the ambassadors of Sweden and Finland. From a cultural and mental point of view, Sweden and Finns have, of course, been part of our Western European community ever since we were reminded of them. It is good that they are now drawing the military consequences of this. It feels like friends living in the same house. Yet this accession has nothing festive. The reason is literally a bloody serious one, namely the military rudeness with which Russia is currently housed on our continent. Human lives, even of their own soldiers, have no value to the Kremlin when it comes to power. President Putin is also sacrificing his own economy, i.e. the prosperity and well-being of his own Russian citizens, on medieval territorial thinking. It's a bit primitive, but at the same time it's ominous. 50PLUS represents the generation who lived in the threat of the Cold War after the Second World War. We remember the air bridge to Berlin. We remember Hungary. The frightening chess between Kennedy and Khrushchev about the rockets in Cuba. The building of the Wall. The rebellion in Prague and, finally, Poland. The Cold War was unpleasant, often ominous. America came in 1947 with the Doomsday Clock, the clock that indicated how far we were still removed from total destruction. This one started with seven for twelve, and stood on two for twelve. After the fall of communism, the clock returned to seventeen for twelve. That clock was not only a symbol of the threat of uncertainty, but also of determined vigilance. We were in class. After the fall of communism, after the reunification of Germany and after Gorbachev, we hoped so fervently that blunt policy of power would be completed in the past. The youth sang the music of Hair in those years: ""When the moon is in the Seventh House and Jupiter signs with Mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars."" The twenty-first century would be the Aquarius and of love and peace. Do you remember? Happy, but touching naive at the same time. We didn't have to be vigilant ourselves anymore. As we danced and sang, the stars would bring us peace. But the violence echoed the Balkans. The Twin Towers didn't help. The Arab Spring turned out to be mostly autumn. It remained restless, but fortunately not too close to the door. That illusion too is now over. The senseless destruction and the devastation of people are only one street further and can be seen and felt from our garden. In our streets, the refugees walk. Mr. Chairman. Sweden and Finland are strong countries. Both share borders with Russia: Finland over land and Sweden over the Baltic Sea. These strong countries have not known for a moment throughout the Cold War that Russia's threat was felt to be so strong that NATO should still be the safe house. But they have that feeling now. Mr. Chairman. That frightens me. That is why I welcome both countries as friends of a long time, but I cannot make a happy face. The circumstances are not festive, but alarming. 50PLUS expects the Netherlands and NATO to welcome Finland and Sweden in the spirit of the quality shown by these countries during the entire Cold War. That is to say, serious, vigilant, in such a military situation that Russia is really going to feel where the border it has crossed is. The coming years will not be easy, not even economically. Buying off money from one problem after another by this cabinet will not be possible in any way. The belt is coming back into the picture for the government and for all of us. The prosperity ring of the global economy is over and the hangover shows a divided world where only its own importance counts. Mr. Chairman. In the long run, that's not a solution. In fact, in the long run, that's fatal. This can only lead to friction, conflict and ultimately violence and destruction. Let us therefore do what needs to be done, invest in a strong defence that deters any power from even pointing at us. Realize that our economy is getting strong headwinds. The international market is getting more restless and smaller. There will be regular energy shortages. In the meantime, climate must also be a priority. Let us in the West stop political polarization and spoilt prosperity bickering. The problems are a little bigger than all these modern hypes. The freedom of the West is the basis for an international society in which every human being counts and prosperity can be widely shared, without making an irresponsible change on our planet. Finally, Mr President. 50PLUS will radiate that image, determinedly. Playtime's over. By the way, did you know that the Doomsday Clock is currently at 1 minute and 40 seconds before 12? He's never been this close to midnight. Mr. Chairman. The 50PLUS Group will vote with conviction in favour of ratification of the Treaty.

301,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u38,"Mr. Chairman. We consider Sweden and Finland to be friendly countries with the Netherlands. Military cooperation with both countries is self-evident. However, the accession of both countries to NATO is not self-evident. NATO could always function well without both countries, even during the hottest moments of the Cold War. Military cooperation with Sweden and Finland remains perfectly possible without these countries becoming members of NATO. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweden and Finland feel threatened, understandably. It is clear that NATO membership is in the interests of both countries. The question before us, however, is whether this membership is also in the interest of the Netherlands. An affirmative answer is not obvious. After all, it would mean that the Netherlands would take on an additional duty to defend more than 1,300 kilometres of border with Russia, which until now could be regarded as a buffer zone. In addition, NATO is both a political and a military organisation. Membership of Sweden and Finland limits the political space that the Netherlands currently has to react if one of these two countries were to be attacked unexpectedly. Decision-making on such an important question should therefore be carried out in an extremely careful manner. I have already heard glowing speeches here expressing our warm feelings towards our friends in Sweden and Finland. But even when we're talking about friendly countries, we have to keep our heads down. This is a balancing of interests: on the one hand the interests of Sweden and Finland and on the other hand the Dutch interest. It's not that that's why I put on an orange tie, but it fits into tonight's design. Mr. Chairman. Now the Dutch Minister of Defence wants to have Swedish nationality, in addition to the Dutch Minister of Defence. For the record, we have no objection to double nationalities. The more nationalities someone has, the better for us. Normally, dual nationality does not raise any objections, but in this situation it does. If a balance is to be made between the interest of Sweden and the interest of the Netherlands, there may be a conflict of interest between a ruler of both nationalities. We see the problem of conflict of interest in some parts of society. Codes of conduct have been introduced to regulate this; think of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

302,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u64,"Thank you, Mr President. The Russian raid in Ukraine makes our Western world tremble. Sweden and Finland, who longed to remain neutral for years, decided in a few months to seek protection from NATO. My group agrees with the accession of these two countries to NATO. The first and most important reason for this is that we do not want to abandon countries that feel threatened by Russian aggression, which meet the requirements of NATO membership. They may join the defensive alliance. At the same time, it is worth remembering that NATO itself is also being strengthened by the accession of Sweden and Finland. This enlargement will enable us to better defend the northern and eastern borders of the alliance, including the fragile Baltic states, even if the border with Russia is almost doubled. The expansion of NATO is a powerful signal towards Russia. The attack on Ukraine does not weaken the West, but makes it stronger. There is also a first question from my group. Russia has made serious threats if Sweden and Finland join NATO. NATO certainly should not bow to that. But how does the Minister assess the seriousness of these threats? Is the Netherlands, is NATO sufficiently prepared for any repercussions, military or non-military? And are measures being taken to prepare us for this? What is the position of Sweden and Finland during the period when their membership is not yet official? Can there be support for possible aggression from Russia? And what could it look like? I would like to hear a response from the ministers. Mr. Chairman. A concern of our group is the MoU which is closed between Sweden, Finland and Turkey in order to veto Turkey. We understand that the government's position is that the Netherlands is outside. Officially, of course, it is. However, my group would find it particularly harsh if some Turkish refugees who have taken refuge in Sweden or Finland had to pay the price for the accession of these countries to NATO. Can the Minister confirm to us that where the Netherlands has an opportunity to exercise influence for the better in this area, the Minister will not fail to do so? Mr. Chairman. My group has always been in favour of the transatlantic link and NATO. That is why we will support this proposal.

303,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u68,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A brief contribution on my part. It is good that the ambassadors of Finland and Sweden are present in the debate. We appreciate that very much; thank you very much. Mr. Chairman. The VVD Group wholeheartedly supports the accession of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and therefore the adoption of the present NATO protocols. The changing geopolitical situation after Russia's raid in Ukraine is looming in many areas. Many countries change their security and defence policy on the basis of the situation that has arisen, just like we in the Netherlands. This morning we discussed, among other things, the accelerated purchase of the F-35 and the drones. It is gratifying to note that this has brought the European countries together more urgency and that they are now much more aligned. It is, of course, understandable that the European countries Finland and Sweden now want to increase their own security by joining NATO, so that they can claim the umbrella provided by Article 5, which has already been mentioned by many groups. Both Finland and Sweden have been working closely with NATO countries and NATO structures for a long time. They practice a lot together, too. I have also talked a lot about it in my time in Brussels. They have a strong and well-developed military force and therefore meet all the criteria for accession. But in addition to the fact that this accession of course means a great deal to these countries themselves, it is also very important for the treaty organisation. The accession of Finland and Sweden strengthens the European pillar within NATO. In addition, the north flank of these countries is now within the Convention Area. On that side, there have been major concerns for some time about the development of the climate change, the melting ice cap and thus the emergence of new transit routes and the struggle for raw materials, the security situation there. The same applies to the difficult geographical situation of the Baltic States. Of course, there's no depth in it. Kaliningrad is next to it, between Poland and the Baltic States. And behind them, in the back, is the Baltic Sea. The connection between Finland and Sweden will better cover their backs. It also dramatically strengthens the position of NATO in the Baltic Sea. In short, it is important for NATO to welcome both countries, Finland and Sweden, with open arms. They are an important reinforcement for NATO, which will enable European democracies to defend their security, interests and democratic values in a united manner. That is also in the interest of the Netherlands.

304,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14.u71,"Mr President, thank you. May I begin by expressing my deep gratitude to the Chamber, to the chairman of the committee and to all the Members present for the virtually unprecedented speed. I remember from another past that there often has to be a lot on the last days before the recess and that rabbits sometimes come out of the hat where there is a feeling that it must be done very quickly. I do not know if it is without precedent at all, but this is taking place on such an important subject, with so many repercussions, with very, very high speed. Of course, it is not for me to anticipate the final decision-making in this Chamber, but the cabinet is very grateful to the House of Representatives, the Council of State and also the First Chamber for doing so as quickly as possible. I would have liked to have said that again, because I know what that means in the last few days before the recess. Mr. Chairman. Many Members of your Chamber have referred to the totally changed context and to the unprecedented times in which we live. Perhaps you can say that the fact that we have this debate is the most important and best illustration of this. It is not so long ago that when you spoke to friends, colleagues or others in Sweden or Finland about whether NATO was not what it would be for them, you were cognisantly looked at and referred to a distant and distant future. I have already referred to the discussions I had with my Swedish and Finnish colleagues at the time in a committee Chamber, as well as having had a long and unsuccessful dialogue with Norway on the European Union, for example. The fact that this has been viewed so differently in Finland and Sweden and subsequently in NATO countries in recent months shows that something is really happening in Europe and in the world. It shows that something is really going on and that the war in Ukraine is under unprecedented pressure on security, stability and peace in Europe for the first time since the Second World War. So this has motivated both countries to take this step. This too has just been acknowledged, and I am quite right to say so, by not every speaker who has mentioned it. We have all read that there were administrators, and I believe the President of Finland and others, who, until very shortly before the attack, thought they could understand from the words of the Kremlin and of Putin personally that this would not of course happen. I then understand very well that, if you get that personal insurance and that war is going on, the conclusion must be that Putin's word and the Kremlin's word when it comes to it are potentially worthless. The combination with all the horrors that we see makes Sweden and Finland take this step and ultimately also makes us having this debate here today. I will, of course, try to answer all the other questions that have been asked as well as possible. I've already done a few things in the introduction, but I'll mention one more thing about what we're trying to do with the war. Mrs Karimi and a number of other speakers also referred to the wider context. Then I come to the accession negotiations even more specifically. The most important thing is to enable Ukraine, through the weapons we supply, the sanctions that we announce, the aid for reconstruction and diplomatic aid, as well as possible, and to keep it, sometimes against the cliffs, in order to preserve its own sovereignty. We will continue to do so as a Dutch cabinet, and I believe that feeling and intention are much broader in Europe and in North America. The second thing we are trying to do, as I said earlier, is to ensure that this does not lead to a major conflict. This has gotten out of sight, because the reports in the newspaper have also changed a bit. We aim that this would not lead to things that would potentially mean a much greater war. That is one of the reasons why NATO countries are individually taking significant steps in helping Ukraine in the military field and NATO is not a party at the same time and should not want to become a party in this war. I think that is exactly the right way to balance things. On the third point, I would also like to be explicit. That is what we, as a cabinet, would like to see, and I suspect that this House can count on broad support for what should be left to Putin and other dictators looking at this conflict. In any case, it must remain on the screen that the price for this kind of thing is so high that dictators will change their minds in the future before they take such a step. The international community must show that there is no room for imperialism in the 21st century. That is essential, because if that is not the conclusion, but the conclusion is that you will eventually get away with it, then you also have to take serious account of more of this kind of very considerable inefficiencies in the future. So that's what we're trying to achieve with each other in the war. Mr. Chairman. Then there are a number of safety issues. A number of Members have asked for this. I believe that Mrs Moonen, Mrs Karimi, Mr Koole and Mr Otten have asked about safety guarantees in the meantime. That is a very relevant question, because that is precisely one of the things that was recognised shortly after the establishment of NATO as something in the design of NATO to which you have to relate. If a country says it wants to join and the NATO treaty says it is at war and part of its territory is occupied by the enemy, then that makes accession impossible. So you want to prevent one square millimeter from being occupied by a country in order to make accession impossible. This has led the United States, the United Kingdom and others to say that they are pro-actively coming up with security guarantees. That's exactly the way it should be, I think. As the Netherlands, as Minister Ollongren said, under Article 42 (7) of the EU Treaty, we are also obliged to contribute. This feeling lives very strongly and widely in the European Union. My firm impression is that Sweden and Finland, on the one hand, have also found it very uncomfortable that it seemed that the discussion would last longer. At the same time, it has motivated many parliaments and governments to take much speed in this no-man's land in which we are now governed by treaty. Moreover, that period between application for membership and membership is covered by those security guarantees.",True,0.075,0.829,0.096,0.9323,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 14 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 14,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,WopkeHoekstra,"Hoekstra, Wopke",M,1975,47.0,False,7

An article 100 letter deals specifically with the activities of the Dutch armed forces outside the NATO territory. Nevertheless, activities in the NATO territory are often accompanied by extensive communication towards the Chamber. In such a situation, we are really talking about a very extreme as-the-dance situation, and it is very obvious in Dutch political relations that the dialogue with Parliament should be sought. I'd like to make a formal commitment to that, too. Then you can always discuss whether that means that you will never do anything operational without consulting the States General. Everyone will understand that the urgency may sometimes require matters from a cabinet. Of course, the cabinet will be informed in such a case, where we are all widely provided with information in the media and where you are sure that a similar discussion will take place in a variety of countries, as the dialogue with the States-General is looking for it. I'd like to say one more time that nothing is out of the question. We're a long way in when-then, if-then, when-then. I do not want to leave it on the screen that the cabinet sees this as a probable scenario in the next few weeks or months. Mr. Chairman. Mrs Karimi asked about the United States and the elections there. I would like to stress once again that the United States is an essential ally for the Netherlands, but also for NATO. You can imagine that if you are present at those NATO meetings, you will look around the room and wonder what everyone, not only in terms of the size of the population, but also in terms of military capacity, is able to put one incomparable with all the others. That's the United States. I think we should be fortunate that they have been so actively involved and so involved on this continent. In my belief, they will remain so. There are many issues on which there is still some disagreement in the United States regarding domestic politics, but in foreign policy we have seen a great deal of agreement in recent months, regardless of party affiliation. Mr. Chairman. Mr Van Apeldoorn asked for a floor of the schism between east and west, the lowering of a new iron curtain. It is important to emphasise once again to what and to whom we owe this conflict. We have seen that there were all kinds of things that could not be accepted at all, earlier in Ukraine, in Georgia and in all kinds of other places. I am not even talking about cyber attacks, which Sweden has suffered under the radar in the military sense, and mention all these small and large examples. It has been Putin who has decided to pull more than 100,000 troops together for the border of Ukraine. Although many had hoped for a different outcome, Putin finally decided to simply attack a sovereign country, where to address the greatest horrors, not to care about international law and so on. Does that mean that we are fired from diplomatic efforts or other efforts? No, of course not. But we must also continue to see this situation for what it is, namely, completely, but totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, totally, And that also means that that cannot mean business as usual at this stage, nor, in my view, in the short term or in the medium term.",True,0.063,0.856,0.081,0.8338,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 14 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 14,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,WopkeHoekstra,"Hoekstra, Wopke",M,1975,47.0,False,7

Mr Frentrop asked whether the accession of Finland and Sweden was also in Dutch interest. I'd like to argue that it is. I have just indicated why I understand very well that Finland and Sweden are making this choice. That is quite something for Finland, if you look at the history of the Winter War and of decades of being very well-equipped for a possible war, but on the other hand keeping formally distance from NATO. It's also quite something for Sweden. Sweden has a history of about 200 years of neutrality. The only time the Swedish government delivered weapons to another country was during the Finnish-Russian war. It is now said that I understand that assessment very well and I also support it that, on the basis of the current safety situation, there is a need for a different type of guarantee and another safety umbrella. That is the choice for NATO. Then there is the question of what this means to us. Of course, you extend the group of countries to which you make a commitment from 30 to 32 or, in the case of the Netherlands, from 29 to 31. That's true. But these are two countries that are very close allies from the European Union. There are few countries with whom we are so like-minded. Moreover, we already have treaty obligations under the Treaty on European Union. They are countries which meet all the criteria of NATO's open policy. We have just discussed the rule of law in detail, but you would like many countries to have the rule of law, democracy and all the procedures that go with it in order as these two countries. Then one final piece. That would not otherwise have been an exclusion criterion, but it does help enormously. These are two countries which have their own defence very, very, very well in order. In Finland, this has come from a much longer history and Sweden has become wise, in particular, because of what has happened over the past fifteen years. They are countries that have really learned the lessons of history better and have also been less fooled by the peace dividend than some others. In this respect, therefore, they are of great military added value to the alliance. I agreed with Mr Beucker that the 2% remained important. He knows the commitment of the Netherlands to work towards this during this cabinet period. I can say it's actually seen. The US President has referred to it and others, including NATO, have seen the Netherlands take a very big extra step in addition to the 3 billion of the coalition agreement and grow to that 2% already during this cabinet period.",True,0.041,0.795,0.164,0.9964,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-14,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 14 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 14,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,CDA,Christen-Democratisch Appèl,Coalition,Centre to centre-right,WopkeHoekstra,"Hoekstra, Wopke",M,1975,47.0,False,7
309,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2.u3,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. After a long debate yesterday on CETA, we are today discussing the amended Defence budget to speed up the acquisition of additional F-35 and Reaperdrones. Several issues, however, have in common that are decided on in the context of international instability and a terrible war on the European continent. This has already convinced our party that additional investments in defence are necessary to keep our country and the EU safe. That is why a great deal of extra money has been allocated to finance these investments. The recently published Defence Paper makes proposals to guide these investments. The purchase of the six additional F-35 and the four Reaperdrones fits in the line of the Defence Note. But we have to decide very quickly. This summer the orders have to be placed, otherwise we understand that the Netherlands will be at the back of the queue, which will result in years of loss of time and probably also additional costs. Our group can, because of the geopolitical situation, justify rushing orders, but still has a number of questions. Following the Defence Note, the new Strategic Concept was adopted very recently at the NATO Summit in Madrid, which was dramatically different from the old one of 12 years ago, where, for example, Russia is a partner of NATO. But, so I ask the government, if the Strategic Concept has changed so much, how does the further expansion of the F-35 arsenal fit in? The purchase of the F-35, then called JSF, was decided in the same years as that in which the old Strategic Concept was drawn up. Can the Minister or the Secretary of State explain how the extension to three squadrons F-35 fits in with the new NATO strategy? As far as the Reaperdrones are concerned, they are unmanned aircraft, intended to collect crucial data. Can the government confirm that this is indeed about data collection, and therefore information-driven action by the drones? At the end of last year, the International Affairs Advisory Council published a report on autonomous weapons systems. In it, the Advisory Council rejects fully autonomous weapons. There must always be human control at stake. The drones we are talking about today have no weapons, let alone are autonomous. But can the government confirm that the order now, of these four drones, in no way precedes the decision at a later stage to supply these drones with weapons or not? Mr. Chairman.

The Defence Memorandum and the Strategic Compass of the European Union contain a great deal of information on the need for European cooperation, including in the purchase of military equipment. Although the six F-35s that the government now wants to order are made in Italy, they come from American factories. This is a lot of money, which records the use of a particular type of aircraft for a longer period of time. Can the government therefore explain how this acquisition relates to the aforementioned need for European cooperation in the purchase of military equipment? Has this been discussed with the other Member States of the European Union? Finally, Mr President. The PvdA supports the increase in the Defence budget and also the present proposal for a rapid decision on the F-35 and the Reaperdrones. However, despite the need for this in international circumstances, the PvdA Group believes that the ultimate objective of arms control and non-proliferation should not be overlooked.

314,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2.u12,"Mr. Chairman. That's correct. It is heartfelt that I also speak on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the Animals. Today we are talking about several supplementary defence budgets which, if adopted by this Chamber, will lead to a substantial increase in our military expenditure. A large majority of the House of Representatives at least supports this. The sentiment that we must now quickly increase our military expenditure is somewhere to be understood, because there is an unprecedented war in Europe. An attack and conquest war that blatantly violates the most fundamental standards of international law and has caused a great deal of death and destruction. Putin's unprecedented imperialist aggression still kills hundreds of people every day. However, the sentiment is understandable that, according to our political groups, we need to equip ourselves more quickly to defend democracy. At least it is not based on a sober analysis of the facts. It wrongly ignores the great risks to our security that such a huge leap, eventually a structural increase of 5 billion a year, entails in our military spending. Of the total of 2 trillion dollars, or 2,000 billion dollars, spent annually by the world on defence, NATO is responsible for 1.1 trillion. The European part of NATO alone spends about four times as much on defence as, for example, Russia. Russia's economy is the size of that of the Benelux. Furthermore, almost all NATO countries have substantially increased their defence expenditure since 2014. What does the Minister actually think of these figures? Does she think it is irrelevant, or does she have an opinion on it? I'd like a response. Nor is the Russian army that impressive; after four months of war that much has turned out to be so. It takes Russia the greatest effort to conquer a relatively small part of Ukraine, the Donbas. Conquering the entire Ukraine and subjects, as was the original plan, Putin has long given up. This does not mean that there is no threat to the rest of Europe of Russia's unprecedented aggression against Ukraine. It is precisely Russia's relative economic and conventional military weakness combined with the fact that it is a massive nuclear power, which poses a threat and the risk of an even greater and much more devastating war. It is also because of weakness that Russia has now fallen back on this most primitive form of foreign policy, a territorial conquest war that we actually thought we had left behind by the twentieth century.",True,0.147,0.74,0.113,-0.9697,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 2 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 2,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,SP,Socialistische Partij,Opposition,Left,BastiaanvanApeldoorn,"van Apeldoorn, Bastiaan",M,1970,52.0,False,7
315,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2.u17,"Yes. Then it will become clear that we are not entirely in agreement, I say to Mr Arbouw. The threat is real, but the answer is not to arm us to the teeth. Of course, we must be able to defend the NATO territory, but according to the SP and Animal Party groups we are also able to defend the current level of our defence spending, especially if we reprioritise and stop spending money on expensive and even counterproductive missions and interventions such as in Afghanistan, and also if European NATO countries are to cooperate more, for example to avoid unnecessary duplication. Can the Minister respond to this? Because in the Defence Note, I'm missing the justification why we should do so much more. Sure, there's a lot of late maintenance on parts. I say that to Mr Arbouw, but I have just said that. The state of our army and the equipment can be improved. The Group of the Party of European Socialists believes that a substantial investment in improving the working conditions of our men and women in the army should also be made. It's being done now. There is certainly a catch-up to this. But this does not require an increase of structural 3 billion per year, let alone 5 billion. Mr President, then there are the risks. I was just talking about that. The big risk is, of course, the following. While NATO, which already spends so much more than any other country that is seen as an opponent or challenger, is going to spend even more, the risk is that these countries will do the same, not to be left behind and otherwise the military balance of power will be completely lost. Then you will have an arms race which will benefit the arms industry in particular, but which will certainly not increase our security. Can the Minister respond to that? Does she see that risk, and if she doesn't, why not? Mr. Chairman. In my field, this is called the safety dilemma. What you do as a country to increase your own security can increase the insecurity of other countries, which react to it by further arming themselves. There is another reaction to that, and so on. As a result, the world as a whole is deteriorating in safety. That means that international security will be reduced. I'd like a reflection from the Minister. Does she see this potential risk with us? If not, why not? Mr. Chairman. I would like to comment specifically on the incidental supplementary budget which is intended to speed up the purchase of new defence equipment already announced in the Defence Note. It's war in Europe. But that does not mean that we have to take decisions in a careless, hasty way, which are probably also unwise. That is what, according to the groups of the SP and the Party for Animals, is here. I am not careful to start with this because we are now in a situation as the First Chamber in which we have to decide on a legislative proposal that came our way only a week ago. There has been no time for any written preparation. And this is not a small matter, it is an issue of EUR 1.1 billion for new weapons: six F-35s, formerly called JSF, and four so-called Reaperdrones. Normally such a large expenditure would be announced long in advance as part of the normal budgetary process, and not through an incidental supplementary budget. This is highly unusual in such an issue and, as far as my group is concerned, it is also undesirable. The Minister may say, as I have heard her do in the House of Representatives, that Parliament's budget law is respected in this way too, but although this may be true in a formal sense, the exercise of budget law is, in fact, rather flawed in this way. Can the Minister respond to that? My group deeply regrets the lack of democratic care.

316,ParlaMint-NL_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2.u19,"Thank you. The latter is certainly correct. However, the problem is this. The government is giving a number of arguments why we should do it now, accelerated. Otherwise we close in the back of the line; then we miss the boat, the costs rise and it becomes more expensive. First of all, my group did not even have the opportunity to consider these arguments properly, because we were told this last week. Secondly, the first and fundamental question is, of course, whether we want this purchase. Do we even want to buy that new equipment? I'm about to say something about that. And if we have any doubts about that, then those arguments will also be in a different light. That is the problem for our groups. The SP and the Party for Animals have always been against the billion-dollar JSF project with other parties, such as GroenLinks. Now GroenLinks is likely to be the case in the House of Representatives, but we will see how we are going to agree to the purchase of a new shipment of JSF bombers, together with the original opponents PvdA and D66, who then turned. Together they now make it possible for the Netherlands to rush a lot of taxpayers' money and, in our opinion, to put it into this weaponry. We would much rather invest in diplomacy, an area in which the Netherlands has a name to uphold. Then the proposed purchase of the Reaperdrones. Those drones, unmanned aircraft, they can also be armed. In fact, on page 28 of the recently published Defence Note I referred to it just now, we read that Defence is going to invest in the armament of these unmanned aircraft. That decision has yet to be made. It's a policy idea, and it's got to go through the two chambers. However, I would like to point out here that this is not the path that the SP and Party groups want to take for the Animals. Then where could the cabinet deploy those armed drones? In so-called missions to uphold the international legal order, i.e. military interventions that often achieve the opposite and violate international law, including the law of war and humanitarian law of war? We all know what the Americans who have used Reaperdrones for in recent years, namely as a weapon in the so-called war against terror; a war in violation of international law that has fueled terrorism rather than fought it. We also know how much the civilian population of countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and in particular Pakistan have been affected by the deployment of armed drones. In a report based on extensive scientific research, Living Under Drones, of an American collective of lawyers specialized in international humanitarian law and human rights from 2012, already ten years ago, these experts claim that the American drone war in Northwest Pakistan caused gross violations of international humanitarian law. They also show that this form of counter-terrorism itself was perceived for the population as a form of daily terror: daily terror because people lived in constant fear of the so-called Hellfire missiles equipped with those drones, which in so many cases did not encounter terrorist suspects, but innocent men, women and children. If we had had the time to prepare properly, I would have asked the Minister if she was familiar with this report. I strongly recommend that she take note of this. Of course, the weapon does not fully determine its use, but the question is what the government would want to use these Reaperdrones for if they were to be armed in the future. At least that's the government's policy idea. Can the government exclude that they will ever be deployed by the Netherlands in this way, with so much so-called collateral damage, a rather terrible euphemism for bombing unarmed civilians? Is there not the risk that such collateral damage could occur quickly in the use of these weapons even faster than in the deployment of manned aircraft? Can the Minister comment on that? There are studies that indicate that the threshold for drone deployment is lower than that of a manned equivalent. In military circles, it's called being an advantage, because you can kill at a distance without risking being killed yourself. So you can use very local violence more quickly in a high spectrum without risking the lives of our women and men. Is that how the Minister sees it? Does she see this as an advantage? Or does she, with my group, think it is above all a risk that the threshold for using this kind of violence, even during so-called peacekeeping missions, will only be reduced?",True,0.15,0.768,0.083,-0.9976,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 2 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 2,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,notMinister,SP,Socialistische Partij,Opposition,Left,BastiaanvanApeldoorn,"van Apeldoorn, Bastiaan",M,1970,52.0,False,7

On the other hand, there is also the commitment to arm these drones. That's what I'm asking the Minister. For the intelligence, you don't need the Hellfire missiles. That's my point. Because, if I may pursue my argument, that's what we're talking about with armed drones. We are talking about pilots who, for example, in the American case, are sitting in the desert in Nevada and there every day behind a screen with some sort of joystick disabling people, killing at the touch of the button of the joystick at thousands of kilometres away. Is that what I, too, like the Netherlands, want, I ask the Minister. Even if only armed warriors are eliminated and no innocent civilians killed, this raises all kinds of ethical questions. Does the Minister recognize that, the big ethical questions that are on the table here? In summary. The groups of the SP and the Party for Animals consider our ability to defend the NATO territory to be important. Unfortunately, in recent years, NATO has focused on very different issues, such as the so-called 'war on terror'.

In fact, there is a capacity question from NATO. All countries are told what capacity is needed to carry out this task at all. There's just a shortage in that capacity. At the moment, we have no preponderance in the air on the eastern flank of our NATO Convention Area. And let's go back to the situation in the Netherlands.

It is a good thing that after years of loss, the government wants to strengthen the Dutch military capacity again; better late than never. If you want peace, you must be prepared for war. A sufficiently strong military capacity is a matter of national importance, perhaps the most important national interest. However, there are organisations active in the Netherlands that oppose this. I am talking in particular about organisations that call on pension funds not to invest in companies that produce weapons. As an example, I would like to mention the annual Fair Pension Guide. This publication assesses the policy of the ten largest pension funds in the Netherlands on social issues every year, and one of these themes is whether the fund invests in the arms industry. Pension funds should not do that, the organisers of the Fair Pension Guide think. Then they don't give out enough. Mr. Chairman. A strong defense is in the national interest. Calling pension funds not to invest in defence then goes against the national interest. For the record, anyone in the Netherlands can appeal to matters that go against the national interest; anyone can criticize the government. My group supports the often used saying: I loathe what you say, but I will defend your right to say it with my life. In fact, you could say that it is the ultimate task of our armed forces to ensure that freedom of expression in the Netherlands is not restricted by foreign powers. Many of the organisations that call on pension funds to stay out of the arms industry, receive subsidies and other financial support from the government, mostly through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For the past 20 years, that didn't matter much: then the government also felt that you shouldn't invest in defence capabilities. But now such initiatives are contrary to public policy and to national interests. This raises purely in terms of efficiency questions as to whether it is wise for the government to use taxpayers' money to finance organisations that want to change government policy, as approved by parliament. Again, everyone is free to criticize government policy, and I am not talking about funding political parties. I am talking purely about private organisations, which have often started out as charitable organisations, but have become activists in many areas.

As far as we are concerned, the cabinet has well-founded this, so it understands the speed that is now being exercised. Mr. Chairman. Breaking down a warrior can be very fast, but rebuilding it takes a lot of effort, energy, money and time. That is why it is very important to clearly determine how to get the Dutch armed forces back to the right level as soon as possible.

I'm trying to sort them out a little bit: general questions about security, the Defence Note, then a couple of points about the F-35 and the MQ-9s, and finally perhaps a little bit about the budget. First of all, the whole question of security. Mr Van Apeldoorn, who also spoke on behalf of the Animal Party, outlined the safety dilemma, as he called it. He is, of course, expert in this area, which is why I question his reasoning on that point with some hesitation. Many countries have now decided to invest more in their defence and also in cooperation within the EU and NATO. In some countries, including the Netherlands, but also Germany is an important country at that point.......................................................................................................................................................................... So it is a strengthening that is partly about restoring what you need at least in defence and partly about investing in the armed forces and cooperation within the EU and NATO of the future, mainly in what is needed for a credible deterrent. We have a military force in our defense. We are members of NATO, which is a defensive alliance, a defensive alliance. So it's to prevent us from ever ending up in a war situation. The Netherlands doesn't just do that, but we do that together. So I do not see it as an arms race, but as a necessary investment in weapons and weapons systems to deter them. Terror is only credible when it is actually seen as sufficient. That is what we are aiming for now. Mr Van Apeldoorn then says that I have heard this argument many times, including from others from his party, that NATO invests more money in arms than the Russian Federation and that the Russian economy is smaller than ours. That is all true, but at the same time, unfortunately, because of the current way of warfare of the Russian Federation, we see that this is an aggressor who is unavoidable and does not hesitate to deploy almost the most conceivable conventional weapons, in which human lives do not seem to play a role, either on the military side or on the civilian side, and in which everything that comes on their path is destroyed. In other words, when you talk to people from the Baltic states, for example, they call Irpin and say: we do not want that to be our foreland. That is what we must now stand up to: a real threat of the commitment of everything they have, conventionally. We're gonna have to arm ourselves against that. The second thing I would like to mention on that point is that although NATO was once established because of the Soviet Union, it is not the only threat. Russia, of course, plays a very important role in NATO philosophy. The new Strategic Concept also identifies Russia as a real longer-term threat, but it is not the only threat. We are now seeing, in a sense, a conventional war developing, but of course there is much more. It actually started with some kind of hybrid warfare. There's also a threat in cyber. It happens every day. There's a threat of a war through space. The other threats are also not removed: the threat of terrorism, the threat that can eventually come from things like climate change. So it is much more than the Russian threat, but the Russian threat has been the trigger to rebuild it now and improve it for the future.",True,0.168,0.749,0.083,-0.9973,ParlaMint-NL-en_2022-07-12-eerstekamer-2,"Report of the meeting of the Dutch Upper House, Meeting 38, Session 2 (2022-07-12)",2022-07-12,Upper house,Meeting of the 36th Eerste Kamer,Session 2,Meeting 38,Sitting 2022-07-12,-,"COVID,War",English,Guest,notMP,Minister,D66,Democraten 66,Coalition,Centre,KajsaOllongren,"Ollongren, Kajsa",F,1967,55.0,True,7

We need to rethink and think about how we are dealing with the new geopolitical situation. I do not yet want to promise Mr Koole and the Chamber that we will come up with such a vision, also because it is not just up to me. This really is something of the cabinet, especially of course something of the Foreign Minister. We are now giving priority to making sure that we do what is necessary to strengthen the armed forces in order to be able to play our role within the EU and NATO. This other side is there, too. I really think that's something we should operate on with the State Department. What I do want to promise is that I will take the suggestion to the cabinet and we will come back to how we want to deal with it in the future. Let's see. I thought I actually answered all the questions around the F-35, so I'll go over to some of the questions that have been asked about the Reaper. In fact, all these questions relate to something that is not currently being proposed, namely the Reaper's armament. Several spokesmen have rightly noted that the cabinet has announced the intention of arming the Reaper, but that is not part of the proposal that lies here. That is something that we will be discussing in detail with the Chamber. First of all, through the debate that I will have with the House of Representatives in any case, together with the Foreign Affairs colleague on the cabinet response to the AIV report. I believe that we sent that to the Chamber on 17 June. This concerns the recommendations made by the AIV on the deployment and regulation of autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons. You have seen that the cabinet wants to take on board the recommendations broadly and that we are therefore thinking about what that means. It will be debated in the autumn. Let me say here that we really think it is crucial that this cabinet response also states that there is meaningful human control in the use of autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons. That is the starting point and on that basis we want to conduct the debate and establish the frameworks for ourselves and also internationally. It's not that far. And it is not yet too far away that we are actually acquiring that weaponry. That was announced in the Defence Note. That is also a wish of the House of Representatives. He said that on a motion of censure. So far we have MQ-9s for intelligence gathering, and we also want to use the four additional MQ-9 devices. I thought Mrs Moonen said the same thing in the event of an interruption. So we're using them to support operations. That's what we've actually started and that's what we're going to do. If we go from four to eight later, that means that we would be able to do that work in two places at the same time. But these drones can do more, of course. That is why we are discussing arms. That is another task that will be discussed with the Chamber at another time.

I hope she will at some point do the same with this Chamber. But in the Defence Note, it's just plain clear that this is a government policy idea. There's a policy plan to arm those drones. And now we have to decide today on an accelerated purchase of four new Reaperdrones. We are going to vote on this today. If I combine that with what is stated in the Defence Note, then I think the question is justified as to what the cabinet's considerations are to move towards arming those drones. That question is now justified, even if we are going to talk about it again later. After all, if we agree today to the purchase of those drones, then we have them too. Then we are going to have a debate on arms. But that is also the case now, in the sense that arms is already a policy idea of the cabinet. So I would still like to hear from the Minister about why.

On the agenda is the purchase of four additional Reapers. We already have four. I just said that we have it for the commitment to intelligence and surveillance. So they're really meant to collect intelligence. So we want to buy four more, because then we will be able to do that work in two places at the same time. So that's the argument. We have indeed announced in the Defence Note that we believe that we should be able to arm the drones. Mr Van Apeldoorn is quite right, but that is not on the agenda. That's an announcement in the Defence Note. There are two things that precede that. Firstly, there is a debate on semiautonomous and autonomous weapons systems, as far as I am concerned, following the cabinet response to the AIV report. That goes into the ethical aspect that Mr Van Apeldoorn is talking about. So the mere fact of buying four extra Reapers is not about that. But the prospect of arming the four drones that we already have and the eight we will have in our future is thus preceded by a debate on that AIV report and the cabinet response to it. And this armament is, of course, preceded by the proposal for the purchase of these weapons, which must come from the cabinet.

And, of course, I did say something about it. I said: there is an ethical discussion about it. And the cabinet has already taken a position on this, especially as regards autonomous weapons systems. This is not about autonomous weapons systems, because this Reaper is not an autonomous weapon system. It is a weapon system in which in all cases people ultimately control.

The Minister is talking about all sorts of threats that are coming at us. I do share that view, although I believe that many of these threats do not require a military response. The minister mentioned China among other things. I would like to stress once again that above all we should not participate in what seems increasingly to be a cold war between China and the United States. The Minister and I will not agree on the security dilemma either. I understand what the Minister is saying about the danger of a new arms race, but there is still a risk that, if we invest much more in defence now, this will also strengthen the perception of insecurity of other countries, such as China and Russia, and that the arms control, disarmament and leisure policy that we will eventually have to go to will be further out of the picture. In this respect, I supported earlier Mr Koole's request for a letter on this subject. I understand that the Minister can't promise it now, because it has to come from the entire cabinet. I hope that letter will come in the future. So we do not support the accelerated purchase of F-35s and Reaperdrones. That may be clear by now. I just wanted to come back to the cost argument. We're sure prices will rise, just not yet how much. If we go for fate 17, will those prices be fixed? Or can they go up much further in the course of the project? Of course, we have seen before how costs continue to rise and a billion-dollar project became even more expensive. Finally, Mr President. The minister said it's a policy idea to arm the drones. She put this in the Defence Note to be transparent about this. In this debate, the Minister is less transparent about the reasons behind this policy idea, why we need those armed drones, what we want to use them for, and what questions that could possibly raise.

It is very nice to see that on the last day before your recess. Of course, we are waiting for the votes to be taken. I say to Mr Koole that I will honour the commitment to the debate. I believe that we should have a debate within the cabinet and in the Netherlands on the relationship between the changed geopolitical conditions and the questions of arms control. That intellectual exercise, as Mr Koole calls it, we are going to do. Indeed, the proposals that are before us, and which will hopefully be approved by the Chamber, do not preach and refer for a preliminary ruling, because that is a separate proposal that you will probably be able to see next year. Mr Van Apeldoorn said that we probably do not agree. Moreover, I agree with him that not everything needs a military response. In the end, Defence and the military are part of a larger whole, including in international relations and in geopolitical relations. But it is an important part, even when it comes to non-military threats. There's an interaction between those two. If we say that China is pursuing an extremely assertive policy and has very ambitious goals in terms of their role in the world and their military power, that is something we need to think about in the broad geopolitical sense. Then it is about diplomacy, about economic relations and also about what one might expect there in a military capacity. You have to think about all that. The Secretary of State is about to discuss the prices in lot number 17. You'll get that answer from the Secretary of State. I have just given an answer on the weapons and the Reapers in response to Mr Koole. Then Mr Frentrop. I'm sorry I left his question in the first place. I would have answered it, but the Secretary of State answered it very well. The only thing I could add to that answer is that it is a real point. We are also discussing how to deal with this at European level. We want to promote strategic autonomy in Europe. We do need that arms industry. We also want the arms industry to deliver faster now. That's where we see bottlenecks. This means that you also have to face up to it: what does it mean if certain investors exclude themselves from it? So I do not find it strange that this issue should be raised here. But I would really advise against the solution proposed in the motion for a resolution on this matter. I also think that Mr Frentrop himself said in his first term that we are living in a democratic rule of law. That includes power and counterpower. NGOs have an important place in our country, in the type of democracy we want to be and the type of free society we want to be. So there is room for all kinds of opinions, also critical opinions. If every critical view of an NGO is a reason to close the subsidy tap, then I think we are not on the right track. That's why I'm dissuading the motion.
